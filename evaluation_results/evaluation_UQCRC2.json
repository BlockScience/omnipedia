However, it does not repeat any specific information that would be found in an infobox, such as the title, authors, or publication date. The sentence is concise and does not unnecessarily repeat information, thus meeting the requirement well. The score is slightly less than perfect because the context of the infobox is not provided, so there is a small chance of overlap."
