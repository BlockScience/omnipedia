            "The sentence provides a citation for a journal article, which is typically concise and does not repeat information unnecessarily. However, without context from the infobox, it's unclear if any of this information is repeated. Assuming the infobox contains similar citation details, the sentence could be seen as redundant, but it is also possible that this citation is necessary for clarity or emphasis. The score reflects a generally good adherence to the requirement, with a slight deduction for potential redundancy."
