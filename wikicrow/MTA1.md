# MTA1

## Overview
MTA1 (Metastasis Associated 1) is a gene that encodes the metastasis-associated protein 1, a core component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The MTA1 protein is involved in various cellular processes including cell differentiation, development, and response to stress, primarily through its interactions with other proteins and modification of chromatin structure. It is characterized by several functional domains that facilitate its role in gene expression regulation and interaction with other molecular components. MTA1's relevance extends to pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis in several types of cancers (Li2015Unravelling; Ma2018Prognostic).

## Structure
The MTA1 protein, encoded by the MTA1 gene, exhibits a complex molecular structure integral to its function in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The primary structure of MTA1 consists of 715 amino acids and includes several key domains: the Bromo-Adjacent Homology (BAH) domain, the egl-27 and MTA1 homology (ELM2) domain, the SWI, ADA2, N-CoR, TFIIIB (SANT) domain, and a GATA-like zinc finger domain. These domains are crucial for the protein's interaction with other molecular components within the cell (Millard2014Towards; Kumar2016Structure).

In terms of secondary structure, the BAH domain is characterized by a Î²-sheet structure with additional 3_10 helices, Î²-strands, and ordered loops, forming a Î²-barrel core (Millard2014Towards). The ELM2 domain, while largely intrinsically disordered, includes predicted helical regions and undergoes a conformational change upon interaction with other proteins like HDAC1 (Millard2014Towards).

The tertiary structure of MTA1 includes ordered regions and intrinsically disordered regions, with the SANT domain forming a three-helix bundle around a hydrophobic core (Millard2014Towards). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as HDAC1, where the ELM2 and SANT domains of MTA1 bind to HDAC1, facilitated by a basic pocket at the interface which is important for enzyme activation (Millard2014Towards).

MTA1 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in variants like MTA1-short (MTA1s), which includes a nuclear receptor box motif (LxxLL) that interacts with ERÎ±, indicating functional diversity in different cellular contexts (Millard2014Towards).

## Function
MTA1 (Metastasis Associated 1) is a gene that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. It is part of the Mi2/NuRD complex, which is involved in gene expression regulation through chromatin structure modification. This complex is essential for various physiological processes, including cell differentiation and development (Sen2014Physiological).

In the brain, MTA1 acts as a coactivator for tyrosine hydroxylase transcription, essential for dopamine production, which influences motor function. This interaction involves forming a complex with DJ1 (PARK7) and RNA polymerase II, facilitated by the Pitx3 transcription factor (Sen2014Physiological). Additionally, MTA1 interacts with ER-alpha, impacting aging processes in the brain, and with endophilin-3, affecting endocytosis (Sen2014Physiological).

MTA1 also plays a role in the immune system by modulating cytokine expression in macrophages. It acts as a coactivator enhancing cytokine expression in response to stimuli like LPS, while under basal conditions, it represses cytokine gene expression (Sen2014Physiological). This dual functionality underscores its importance in cellular responses to inflammation and stress, contributing to cell survival and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
MTA1 (metastasis associated 1) is significantly implicated in the progression and aggressiveness of various human cancers. Overexpression of MTA1 is commonly observed in cancers such as nasopharyngeal, oral squamous cell, head and neck squamous cell, esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, and colon cancers. High levels of MTA1 correlate with advanced clinical stages, increased metastasis, and poorer survival rates in patients (Li2015Unravelling; Ma2018Prognostic). Specifically, in nasopharyngeal cancer, MTA1 overexpression is linked to distant metastasis and poor survival, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, it is associated with tumor growth and vascular invasion (Li2015Unravelling; Malisetty2017MTA1).

MTA1's role in cancer is not limited to its overexpression; it also involves interactions with key signaling pathways and other molecular components that influence tumor invasion, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. For instance, MTA1 interacts with tumor suppressor genes like p53 and oncogenes such as c-myc, modulating their effects on cancer progression (Kaur2014Clinical). Additionally, alterations in MTA1 expression affect chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and immune responses, further contributing to its clinical significance in cancer (Li2015Unravelling).

Given its widespread impact on cancer progression and prognosis, MTA1 is considered a potential target for therapeutic intervention, with its inhibition showing promise in reducing malignant phenotypes of various cancers (Toh2014Properties).

## Interactions
MTA1 (Metastasis Associated 1) interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling, gene expression regulation, and cancer progression. MTA1 is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, where it interacts with HDAC1 to enhance the stability and transcriptional activity of HIF-1Î± by promoting its deacetylation (Yoo2006Metastasis-associated). This interaction is crucial under hypoxic conditions or when proteasome activity is inhibited, leading to decreased acetylation and increased stability of HIF-1Î±.

Additionally, MTA1 interacts with the Ku70/Ku80 complex, which is essential in the DNA damage response and repair pathway known as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This interaction occurs both in the nucleus and cytoplasm and is consistent throughout the cell cycle in both cancerous and normal tissues (Liu2018NuRD). MTA1 also binds to various histone peptides, particularly influencing the methylation and acetylation states of histone H3, which are mediated through distinct domains of MTA1 (Sen2014Role).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, MTA1 forms complexes with other proteins such as RBBP4 and RBBP7 within the NuRD complex, competing with histone H4 for binding sites and influencing chromatin structure (Millard2014Towards). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of MTA1 in regulating gene expression and cellular processes critical in cancer pathology.
