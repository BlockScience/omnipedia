# CLPP

## Overview
The human gene CLPP encodes the protein caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase proteolytic subunit (ClpP), which is a serine protease located in the mitochondrial matrix. ClpP is crucial for mitochondrial function and cellular health, primarily through its role in protein quality control. It forms a part of the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease complex, collaborating with the unfoldase ClpX to degrade misfolded or damaged proteins within the mitochondria. This proteolytic activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, particularly in energy metabolism and the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression. The protein's structure, characterized by a tetradecameric assembly, is essential for its activity, allowing the selective degradation of substrates in a regulated manner (Liu2014Dynamics; Nouri2020Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the CLPP protein, encoded by the human gene CLPP, is characterized by a complex arrangement that plays a crucial role in its function as a protease within the mitochondrial matrix. The protein forms a tetradecameric complex consisting of two stacked heptameric rings, which is a common feature observed across various species, indicating a highly conserved structure (Liu2014Dynamics). Each monomer within these rings adopts an Î±/Î² fold, contributing to the overall stability and functionality of the protein complex (Wang1997The).

The primary structure of CLPP consists of a sequence of amino acids that includes a catalytic triad composed of Serine, Histidine, and Aspartate. These residues are crucial for the protease activity of CLPP, facilitating the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in substrate proteins (Liu2014Dynamics). The secondary structure features a combination of alpha helices and beta strands, which fold into a distinct tertiary structure forming the cylindrical tetradecameric assembly (Liu2014Dynamics).

The quaternary structure is defined by the double-ring tetradecamer, which is essential for the protein's proteolytic function. This structure allows for the formation of a proteolytic chamber where substrates are degraded (Liu2014Dynamics). Specific domains within the protein, such as the handle domain and the head domain, play significant roles in the interaction and stability of the tetradecameric assembly (Gribun2005The).

Overall, the structural organization of CLPP is integral to its function in the mitochondrial matrix, where it helps maintain protein quality control by degrading misfolded or damaged proteins.

## Function
The human gene CLPP encodes the ClpP protease, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis within the mitochondria. This protease is part of the ATP-dependent ClpXP complex, where it collaborates with the unfoldase ClpX to degrade misfolded or damaged proteins, thus preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional proteins that could lead to cellular damage (Nouri2020Mitochondrial). The activity of ClpP is essential for the integrity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the sustenance of oxidative phosphorylation, which are vital for energy production in cells (Nouri2020Mitochondrial).

ClpP also plays a significant role in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), a stress signaling pathway that enhances the cell's ability to respond to mitochondrial stress by adjusting cellular metabolism and degrading unfolded proteins (Luo2021Human). This response is crucial for restoring mitochondrial function and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

In addition to its role in protein quality control, ClpP influences mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis by regulating the levels of ERAL1, a chaperone involved in the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit, thus impacting mitochondrial protein synthesis (Szczepanowska2016CLPP). This regulation ensures the efficient formation of mitoribosomes, which are essential for mitochondrial translation, further underscoring the protease's pivotal role in cellular health and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLPP gene are strongly associated with Perrault syndrome, a condition characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and ovarian dysfunction. Specifically, Perrault syndrome type 3 (PRLTS3) is directly linked to various mutations in this gene, which disrupt the protein's function by affecting its assembly, peptidase activity, and interaction with its ATPase component, CLPX (Brodie2018Perrault). These mutations include T145P, C147S, and Y229D, each showing distinct effects on CLPP function, with some leading to severe neurological symptoms and profound deafness (Brodie2018Perrault).

In addition to Perrault syndrome, mutations in CLPP are implicated in other severe conditions. For instance, the absence of CLPP in mouse models results in infertility, growth retardation, and hearing loss, mirroring some human conditions (Gispert2013Loss). Furthermore, structural analysis of missense mutations in CLPP has revealed significant changes in the protein structure, particularly at the CLPX binding site, which impairs the formation of the active proteolytic complex, contributing to the symptoms observed in Perrault syndrome (Faridi2021New).

Research also suggests that CLPP mutations can lead to broader mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting various physiological processes and potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases and aging processes due to its role in mitochondrial quality control (Gispert2013Loss).

## Interactions
The human CLPP protein, a mitochondrial matrix protease, is known to interact with various proteins, forming crucial multiprotein complexes essential for mitochondrial function and protein quality control. One of the primary interactions of CLPP is with the ATPase CLPX, forming the CLPXP complex. This complex is pivotal in regulating protein degradation within the mitochondria. The interaction between CLPP and CLPX facilitates the unfolding and translocation of substrates into the proteolytic chamber of CLPP for degradation, a process crucial for maintaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis (Fischer2015Identification).

Additionally, studies have identified several potential substrates and interactors of the CLPXP complex. These include components of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex and elements of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), as well as enzymes from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Notably, core subunits of the electron transport chain complex I and proteins involved in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, such as aconitase and biotin synthase, have also been identified as potential substrates or interactors, highlighting the central role of CLPP in cellular energy metabolism (Fischer2015Identification).
