# MAP6

## Overview
MAP6, or microtubule-associated protein 6, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the stabilization and interaction of microtubules within cells, particularly neurons. The MAP6 protein plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton involved in numerous cellular processes including intracellular transport, cell division, and maintenance of cell shape. Distinct from other microtubule-associated proteins, MAP6 is characterized by its ability to stabilize microtubules against depolymerizing conditions such as cold temperatures and pharmacological agents. The protein exists in several isoforms, which arise due to alternative splicing, and these isoforms vary in their expression and function across different tissues and cellular contexts (SÃ©bastien2018Deletion; Cuveillier2020MAP6). Additionally, MAP6 interacts with actin filaments and participates in cell signaling pathways, further underscoring its multifunctional role in cellular dynamics and structural organization (Peris2018A).

## Structure
MAP6, also known as microtubule-associated protein 6, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by specific domains and motifs that contribute to its function in microtubule stabilization and interaction with other cellular structures. The protein contains Mc and Mn modules, which are crucial for its interaction with microtubules and actin filaments. The Mc modules play a significant role in actin filament dynamics, including nucleation, stabilization, and bundling, and are particularly noted for inducing a straightened filament conformation (Peris2018A). The Mn modules, on the other hand, have a strong affinity for binding to microtubules (Peris2018A).

The MAP6 protein also undergoes significant structural changes in response to temperature variations, particularly the MAP6-F isoform, which exhibits a transition from beta conformations to an unfolded state as the temperature decreases. This unfolding enhances its ability to interact with and stabilize microtubules against cold-induced depolymerization (Delphin2012MAP6-F).

Additionally, MAP6 is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulates its association with microtubules and actin filaments. Phosphorylation by CamKII causes MAP6 to dissociate from microtubules, facilitating its interaction with actin in dendritic spines (Peris2018A).

The protein is expressed in various isoforms, including MAP6-N, MAP6-E, and MAP6-F, generated through alternative splicing and the use of different promoters. These isoforms exhibit distinct properties and localizations depending on the cell type and conditions, highlighting the structural and functional diversity of MAP6 (SÃ©bastien2018Deletion).

## Function
MAP6, also known as microtubule-associated protein 6, is integral to the stabilization of microtubules in human cells, particularly neurons. It protects microtubules against depolymerization caused by factors such as cold temperatures and depolymerizing drugs. This stabilization is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal microtubules, which are essential for proper neuronal function and synaptic plasticity (Cuveillier2020MAP6). MAP6 also plays a role in the formation of intraluminal particles within microtubules, contributing to their stability and functional properties (Cuveillier2020MAP6).

In addition to its role in microtubule stabilization, MAP6 is involved in various cellular localizations, including the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, through mechanisms such as palmitoylation of its N-terminal domains (Gory-FaurÃ©2014Non-Microtubular). This dynamic localization supports MAP6's role in multiple cellular processes beyond microtubule stabilization, including cell signaling pathways (SÃ©bastien2018Deletion).

Furthermore, MAP6 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and participates in cell signaling, which can influence neuronal guidance and polarization. The protein exists in multiple isoforms, which are expressed in different tissues and have distinct functions, highlighting its versatility and essential role in cellular morphology and intracellular transport (SÃ©bastien2018Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MAP6 gene, also known as microtubule-associated protein 6, have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders, notably schizophrenia. Research using animal models, particularly MAP6 knockout (KO) mice, has shown that the absence or reduced expression of this gene leads to behavioral and cognitive impairments that are reminiscent of schizophrenia symptoms, including hyperactivity, severe social withdrawal, and cognitive deficits (Gimenez20173D; Volle2012Reduced). These mice also exhibit abnormalities in neurotransmission systems, such as altered dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, which are critical pathways implicated in schizophrenia (Gimenez20173D; Fournet2010The).

Furthermore, studies have indicated that environmental factors like perinatal stress can exacerbate these behavioral phenotypes in genetically predisposed models, suggesting a gene-environment interaction in the pathology of schizophrenia (Volle2012Reduced). Additionally, the MAP6 gene is located in a chromosomal region associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia, further supporting its role in this condition (Volle2012Reduced).

The clinical significance of MAP6 extends beyond schizophrenia. Alterations in MAP6 expression or function have been suggested to contribute to a broader spectrum of psychiatric conditions, potentially including bipolar disorder, due to its fundamental role in neuronal connectivity and microtubule stabilization (Gimenez20173D; Deloulme2015Microtubule-associated).

## Interactions
MAP6, a microtubule-associated protein, engages in various interactions crucial for neuronal connectivity and signaling. It directly interacts with components of the Sema3E receptor complex, including PlexinD1, Neuropilin1, and VEGFR2, as demonstrated in HEK293T17 cells and subicular neurons (Deloulme2015Microtubule-associated). Additionally, MAP6 binds to the SH3 domains of several proteins such as intersectin1 and the p85 subunit of PI3K, playing a role in the activation of the Akt pathway following Sema3E exposure (Deloulme2015Microtubule-associated).

MAP6 also interacts with Bmcc1s, a brain-specific isoform of Bmcc1. This interaction affects the microtubule interactions of MAP6, influencing cell morphology and actin dynamics in neurons (Arama2012Bmcc1s). Furthermore, MAP6 is involved in calcium signaling regulation through its interactions with Tctex1 and Ca v 2.2/N-type calcium channels, affecting their trafficking and functional expression on the cell surface (Brocard2017MAP6).

These interactions highlight MAP6's role in modulating various signaling pathways and structural components within neurons, essential for proper neuronal function and connectivity.
