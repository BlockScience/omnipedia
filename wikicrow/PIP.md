# PIP

## Overview
PIP, or Prolactin Induced Protein, is a gene that encodes the protein known as prolactin induced protein, which plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathology. The protein itself is not a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein but is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like fold and significant involvement in immune regulation, reproductive processes, and cancer biology. Prolactin induced protein is primarily recognized for its interactions with various proteins, including CD4 and zinc Î±2-glycoprotein, contributing to its role in modulating immune responses and influencing tumor progression. The protein's structure, marked by a distinctive arrangement of beta-sheets, supports its stability and functional interactions, which are critical in both healthy and disease states (Hassan2008Crystal; Hassan2008Prolactin).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the Prolactin Inducible Protein (PIP) is characterized by its complex arrangement of beta-sheets and absence of alpha-helical structures. The protein's secondary structure predominantly consists of seven antiparallel beta-strands organized into two beta-sheets, forming a sandwiched beta-sheet configuration filled with hydrophobic residues. This configuration is similar to domain 7 of fibronectin type III, despite low sequence identity (Hassan2008Crystal; Hassan2008Prolactin).

PIP's tertiary structure exhibits an immunoglobulin fold, which is significant for its function, particularly in its interactions with other proteins such as zinc Î±2-glycoprotein (ZAG). The complex formation between PIP and ZAG involves extensive interactions, including 12 hydrogen bonds and three salt bridges, which contribute to a stable association. This interaction is facilitated by the complementary shapes of PIP and the internal face of the L-shaped ZAG, highlighting a specific and functional protein-protein interaction interface (Hassan2008Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of PIP include glycosylation, with a confirmed glycan attachment at Asn77, consisting of N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG). This modification is crucial for the protein's structure and function (Hassan2008Prolactin). PIP also exists in multiple isoforms due to variations in glycan content and other post-translational modifications, which affect its molecular mass and isoelectric points (Hassan2008Prolactin).

## Function
The Prolactin Inducible Protein (PIP), encoded by the PIP gene, is involved in a variety of molecular and cellular processes that contribute to its role in healthy human cells. PIP is known for its significant function in immune regulation, particularly through its interaction with CD4+ T cells. This interaction is crucial for modulating the immune response, which includes inhibiting the formation of syncytia, a process that can interfere with HIV-1 infection (Hassan2008Prolactin). Additionally, PIP plays a role in mucosal immunity, where it is abundant in mucosal-type tissues and exhibits immunomodulatory properties by binding potently to immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Hassan2008Prolactin).

PIP also contributes to the formation of the enamel pellicle in the salivary system, indicating a protective role in oral health by modulating bacterial colonization (Hassan2008Prolactin). Furthermore, it is implicated in the apocrine differentiation of breast epithelial cells, highlighting its involvement in normal breast tissue physiology (Hassan2008Prolactin). These diverse functions underscore PIP's role in various biological processes, including fertility, immunoregulation, and possibly antimicrobial activity, reflecting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
PIP (prolactin induced protein) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions, primarily through its role in cancer and immune system modulation. In breast cancer, PIP is overexpressed and associated with tumor proliferation and metastasis. It serves as a biomarker for breast cancer, with its expression linked to the development of the disease through the over-expression of prolactin. Studies have shown that PIP can induce mitogenic effects in both normal and malignant breast epithelial cells, suggesting a relationship with breast epithelial hyperplasia (Hassan2008Prolactin). Additionally, PIP expression is significantly upregulated in breast cancer cell lines compared to normal human mammary epithelial cells, indicating its potential as a biomarker for identifying higher grade breast tumors (Gangadharan2018Prolactin).

In the context of immune regulation, PIP plays a role by binding to CD4 and potentially modulating immune responses during insemination. It also interferes with HIV envelope protein/CD4 binding, suggesting a role in HIV infection mechanisms (Hassan2008Prolactin). Furthermore, PIP deficiency in mice leads to reduced CD4(+) T cell numbers and impaired Th1 cell differentiation, affecting immune responses and increasing susceptibility to infections like Leishmania major (Sauer2023Prognostic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PIP in both oncological and immunological contexts, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention and as a diagnostic marker.

## Interactions
PIP (Prolactin Induced Protein) interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various biological processes. It binds with high affinity to CD4, a molecule crucial in the immune system, potentially blocking CD4-mediated T cell programmed death and interfering with HIV envelope protein/CD4 binding (Hassan2008Prolactin). Additionally, PIP has aspartyl protease activity, enabling it to degrade fibronectin, a component of the extracellular matrix, which is significant in mammary tumor progression (Hassan2008Prolactin). This proteolytic activity is crucial for the outside-in activation of the integrin-Î²1 signaling pathway, where PIP interacts with integrin-linked kinase 1 (ILK1) and ErbB2, influencing key downstream signaling targets (Naderi2014Prolactin-Induced). 

PIP also forms complexes with human serum albumin (HSA) in human seminal plasma, which are stable up to 200 mM NaCl, indicating a strong interaction that contributes to the stability of the complex (Kumar2012Human). This interaction might affect sperm motility by interacting with other proteins like ZAG (Kumar2012Human). Furthermore, PIP is involved in the activation of integrin signaling pathways in molecular apocrine breast cancer, where its knockdown results in decreased phosphorylation of key signaling proteins such as ERK, Akt, and CREB1 (Naderi2012Prolactin-induced).
