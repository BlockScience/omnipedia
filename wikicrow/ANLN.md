# ANLN

## Overview
The ANLN gene encodes the protein anillin, an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division where the cell splits into two daughter cells. Anillin is not only essential for the structural organization of the actin cytoskeleton but also interacts with various other proteins to facilitate the formation and constriction of the contractile ring, a key structure in cell division. This protein is involved in several cellular processes beyond cytokinesis, including maintaining cell shape, polarity, and contributing to the formation of cellular junctions. Due to its critical functions in cell division and maintenance, anillin has been implicated in the progression of various cancers and other diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Naydenov2020Anillin; Magnusson2016ANLN).

## Structure
Anillin, encoded by the ANLN gene, is a multifunctional protein crucial for cytokinesis, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its structural and functional diversity. The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 124 kDa but exhibits anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE, suggesting posttranslational modifications or unusual folding patterns (Naydenov2020Anillin; Field1995Anillin).

The N-terminal region of anillin contains actin-binding domains (amino acids 251-454), which facilitate interactions with actin filaments and myosin II, essential for contractile ring dynamics during cell division (Piekny2008Anillin). This region also includes multiple actin-binding sites, allowing anillin to bind more than one actin monomer (Naydenov2020Anillin).

The C-terminal part of the protein features an anillin homology domain (AHD, amino acids 645-980) and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The AHD is crucial for regulating the Rho family of small GTPases and contains a binding site for RhoA, which is vital for the persistent equatorial localization of ANLN during cytokinesis (Piekny2008Anillin). The PH domain mediates interactions with septin filaments and can bind phospholipids like PIP2, playing a significant role in the localization of anillin to the cleavage furrow during cell division (Naydenov2020Anillin).

Additionally, a shorter splice isoform of anillin, missing an exon (508-544 amino acid region), has been reported, though its functional differences have not been explored (Naydenov2020Anillin). This variability in splicing may influence the protein's function and interaction with other cellular components.

## Function
The ANLN gene encodes anillin, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in cytokinesis, the process of cell division. Anillin is essential for the proper formation and ingression of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, facilitating the physical separation of daughter cells. It achieves this by interacting with critical cytoskeletal components such as actin, myosin, and septins, which are integral to the contractile ring at the site of division (Suzuki2005ANLN; Magnusson2016ANLN).

In addition to its role in cell division, anillin is involved in maintaining cell morphology and polarity. During the interphase of the cell cycle, anillin is predominantly located in the nucleus, but it relocates to the cytoplasm and cell cortex during mitosis, where it interacts with various proteins to regulate the cytoskeleton's dynamics (Naydenov2020Anillin; Magnusson2016ANLN). This dynamic localization underscores its versatile role in cellular structure and function.

Furthermore, anillin plays a significant role in the assembly of adherens and tight junctions in epithelial cells, contributing to cellular barrier integrity. It organizes the perijunctional and apical actomyosin cytoskeleton and modulates tensile forces within these structures, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues (Naydenov2020Anillin).

## Clinical Significance
ANLN, the gene encoding the anillin actin-binding protein, is significantly implicated in various human cancers due to mutations and alterations in its expression. Overexpression of ANLN has been observed in multiple tumor types including breast, lung, pancreatic, liver, bladder, and colorectal cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics (Liu2022Pan-cancer; Wang2016Overexpression). Specifically, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ANLN overexpression is linked to tumor progression and shorter cancer-specific survival times (Suzuki2005ANLN). In colorectal cancer, elevated levels of ANLN are associated with deeper tumor invasion, larger tumor size, and worse overall survival, establishing ANLN as an independent prognostic factor (Wang2016Overexpression).

Furthermore, ANLN mutations have been identified in various conditions. A missense mutation in ANLN is linked to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a disease leading to kidney failure (Deng2018Identification). Additionally, a specific mutation in ANLN has been associated with branchio-otic syndrome, marking its first identification with this genetic disorder (Deng2018Identification).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ANLN in both oncological and non-oncological diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention and as a biomarker for disease prognosis.

## Interactions
ANLN, an actin-binding protein, is involved in various physical interactions that are crucial for cell division and cancer progression. ANLN interacts with the c-Myc protein, enhancing the stability of c-Myc and contributing to its oncogenic role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Guo2021Alternatively). This interaction is facilitated by a conserved binding domain at the N-terminal of the ANLN-201 isoform, which is absent in ANLN-210, indicating isoform-specific interactions (Guo2021Alternatively). Additionally, ANLN-210 interacts with the RNA-binding protein hnRNPC, which is essential for the exosomal transfer of ANLN-210 to macrophages, influencing tumor growth through the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Guo2021Alternatively).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, ANLN interacts with various kinases such as PLK1, CDK1, and AURKB, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and mitotic processes (Hu2020Up-regulated). Moreover, ANLN directly interacts with RhoA in breast cancer cells, promoting doxorubicin resistance by activating RhoA and enhancing cell viability (Wang2020). These interactions underline the multifaceted role of ANLN in regulating cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
