# CENPJ

## Overview
CENPJ, or centrosomal protein J, is a gene located on chromosome 13q12.2 that encodes the protein centromere protein J (CPAP). This protein is integral to centriole biogenesis and is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics within the cell. CPAP is characterized by several functional domains, including a microtubule-binding domain and a microtubule-destabilizing domain, which play crucial roles in centriole assembly and stability (Thornton2009Primary). The protein is essential for the proper formation and function of centrioles, which are key components of the centrosome involved in cell division, chromosome segregation, and cellular organization. Mutations in the CENPJ gene can lead to severe developmental disorders, highlighting its critical role in human biology (McIntyre2012Disruption).

## Structure
CENPJ, also known as CPAP, is a multifunctional protein implicated in centriole biogenesis and microtubule dynamics. The protein spans 1338 amino acids and is structured into several distinct domains that confer its functional capabilities (McIntyre2012Disruption). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of CENPJ, known as the G-box or TCP domain, is glycine-rich and plays a critical role in interacting with the STIL protein, essential for procentriole formation and centriolar polymerization (2016 page 13 of 48). This domain forms an extended Î²-sheet capable of multimerizing into fibrils in vitro (2016 page 13 of 48).

Additionally, CENPJ contains a microtubule-binding domain (MBD) and a microtubule-destabilizing domain (MDD), located between amino acids 311-422, which interacts with tubulin to regulate microtubule dynamics (Thornton2009Primary). The N-terminal domain (NTD) is suggested to align along the centriolar microtubules, potentially interacting with the cartwheel spokes or triplet microtubule (2016 page 13 of 48).

The protein also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions or interactions within the cell (McIntyre2012Disruption). Specific mutations in the splice acceptor site of intron 11 lead to the production of transcripts that can result in truncated proteins, impacting the protein's function and associated with genetic disorders such as Seckel syndrome (McIntyre2012Disruption).

## Function
CENPJ, also known as CPAP, is a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in centriole biogenesis and function within human cells. It is essential for the proper formation and function of centrioles, microtubule-based structures that are crucial for various cellular processes such as cell division, motility, and signaling. CENPJ acts as a molecular cap that regulates centriole length by interacting with microtubules through its conserved domains, including the microtubule destabilizing PN2-3 domain and the microtubule stabilizing A5N domain (Jaiswal2023Separation).

The protein is also involved in the cell cycle, particularly in controlling the timing and formation of centrioles during the cell division cycle. During the S-phase of the cell cycle, a single procentriole forms next to each parental centriole, which is crucial for the correct segregation of chromosomes during mitosis (McIntyre2012Disruption). Mutations in CENPJ can lead to abnormalities in centriole number and size, which are critical for cell division and overall cellular architecture, thus affecting organismal outcomes such as brain development and size (Jaiswal2023Separation; Shi2013Human-Specific).

Furthermore, CENPJ interacts with other proteins like STIL and CEP152 during procentriole assembly, highlighting its role in the structural organization within cells (Shi2013Human-Specific). This interaction is crucial for CENPJ's recruitment to the centriole and its function in centriole assembly, supporting normal spindle organization and cell division (Jaiswal2023Separation).

## Clinical Significance
CENPJ, also known as centrosomal protein 4.1-associated protein (CPAP), is implicated in several genetic disorders due to its crucial role in centriole biogenesis and centrosome function. Mutations in CENPJ have been directly associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) and Seckel syndrome. Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly is characterized by a significantly reduced head circumference, more than 3 standard deviations below the mean for age and sex, and is accompanied by mental retardation. A novel four base pair deletion mutation in exon 11 of the CENPJ gene has been identified, which is predicted to result in a truncated protein, correlating with the clinical presentation of MCPH in affected individuals (Gul2006A).

Seckel syndrome, another condition linked to CENPJ mutations, is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, severe microcephaly, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities. Disruption of CENPJ leads to genomic instability, contributing to the cell death during embryonic development, which is a characteristic of the proportionate dwarfism seen in Seckel syndrome (McIntyre2012Disruption). Specific mutations in CENPJ, such as a homozygous splice acceptor mutation in intron 11, lead to exon skipping and potentially truncated protein products, impacting the protein's function and contributing to the Seckel syndrome phenotype (McIntyre2012Disruption).

Furthermore, CENPJ mutations have been linked to obesity and infertility, with deletion of CENPJ in certain progenitors in mice suggesting a new link between centrosome protein dysfunction and these conditions (Ding2020Loss). These findings underscore the diverse clinical significance of CENPJ in human health and development.

## Interactions
CENPJ, also known as CPAP, interacts with several proteins crucial for centriole biogenesis and function. It directly interacts with the cartwheel protein STIL, essential for CPAP recruitment to the centriole and the assembly of the centriole's cartwheel structure. Mutations in CPAP's G-box domain, such as E1235V and D1196N, disrupt this interaction, leading to abnormalities in centriole length and number (Jaiswal2023Separation). Additionally, CPAP interacts with microtubules/tubulin, mediated by its PN2-3 and A5N domains, which play roles in microtubule destabilization and stabilization, respectively (Jaiswal2023Separation). 

CPAP also forms a complex with hSAS6 and STIL, crucial for procentriole formation during the G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle (Tang2011The). This interaction is part of a pathway that includes the recruitment of these proteins to a site at the base of the nascent procentriole. Furthermore, CPAP interacts with other centriolar proteins such as CP110, which is localized specifically to the distal tips of centrioles and plays a role in capping during centriole biogenesis (Schmidt2009Control). This interaction between CPAP and CP110 is described as antagonistic in determining the extent of tubulin addition during centriole elongation. 

These interactions highlight the central role of CENPJ in the structural and functional organization of the centrosome, impacting cell division and stability.
