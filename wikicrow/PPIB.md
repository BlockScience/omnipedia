# PPIB

## Overview
PPIB is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase B (Cyclophilin B, CypB), which is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase belonging to the cyclophilin type. This protein is primarily located in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of cells and plays a crucial role in protein folding, specifically in the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in proteins. CypB is particularly important in the biosynthesis and assembly of collagen, interacting with various collagen-related proteins to ensure proper folding and to prevent premature association between procollagen molecules. The protein's function is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of collagen, which is critical for the proper formation of connective tissues in the body. Mutations in the PPIB gene can lead to severe connective tissue disorders, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, characterized by bone fragility and collagen defects (Pyott2011Mutations; Ishikawa2013A).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the PPIB protein, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase B or cyclophilin B, includes several structural elements crucial for its function. The primary structure of PPIB consists of amino acid sequences that include specific mutations such as N46D, I68F, N73D, A90V, W118R, S144C, and Q148R, which are located on surface residues distal to the substrate binding site and do not significantly affect the enzyme's activity (Skagia2016Structural). The secondary structure features elements like the b4-strand and the L1 loop, which are essential for the protein's function (Skagia2016Structural). The tertiary structure is detailed with descriptions of how mutations like M49L and F99A disrupt a dynamic network of residues essential for the enzyme's conformational changes (Skagia2016Structural).

Regarding the quaternary structure, PPIB interacts with other proteins such as P3H1 and CRTAP to form a ternary complex, crucial for its function in collagen folding (Wu2019Characterization). This interaction suggests that PPIB can undergo conformational changes upon complex formation, as indicated by the partial accessibility of the T155 residue in the complex (Wu2019Characterization).

No specific information on domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms is provided in the available excerpts. Thus, these aspects of PPIB's structure cannot be detailed further.

## Function
PPIB, encoding Cyclophilin B (CypB), is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase located in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) of cells. This enzyme catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds, a critical step in protein folding, particularly for collagen. CypB is essential in the biosynthesis and assembly of collagen, interacting with various collagen-related proteins to ensure proper folding and preventing premature association between procollagen molecules (Choi2009Severe; Ishikawa2013A).

CypB forms complexes with other rER resident proteins such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), cartilage associated protein (CRTAP), and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1). These complexes are involved in multifunctional activities including prolyl 3-hydroxylase, disulfide isomerase, and molecular chaperone functions, crucial for the stabilization and proper folding of procollagen (Ishikawa2015Ziploc-ing; Choi2009Severe). Additionally, CypB plays a role in the coordination of lysyl-hydroxylation and glycosylation in collagen, processes essential for the formation of intra- and inter-molecular crosslinks in collagen fibers (Ishikawa2015Ziploc-ing).

Mutations in PPIB can lead to connective tissue disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), characterized by bone fragility and collagen defects. This highlights the critical role of CypB in maintaining cellular structure and integrity through its involvement in collagen biosynthesis and quality control (Pyott2011Mutations; Ishikawa2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPIB gene, which encodes Cyclophilin B (CyPB), are associated with severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily. These mutations disrupt the normal function of CyPB, leading to abnormal collagen processing and compromised bone integrity. For instance, specific homozygous mutations in PPIB have been identified in clinical cases, resulting in truncated proteins that significantly affect the structural integrity of collagen and bone tissue (van2009PPIB). The absence of functional CyPB protein in affected individuals confirms the pathogenic role of these mutations in OI (van2009PPIB).

Additionally, PPIB mutations have been linked to varying phenotypes of OI, ranging from lethal perinatal to severe deforming types. These mutations lead to the production of overmodified type I procollagen molecules, with delayed chain assembly and abnormal accumulation in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, further contributing to the disease pathology (Pyott2011Mutations).

In more severe cases, mutations in PPIB result in prenatal onset of OI, multiple fractures at birth, significant respiratory issues, and congenital hearing loss, highlighting the critical role of PPIB in bone development and integrity (Caldwell2015Osteogenesis).

## Interactions
PPIB, also known as Cyclophilin B, is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It forms a stable ternary complex with PD4 (a form of P3H1) and CRTAP, which is essential for the prolyl 3-hydroxylation and folding of procollagens in the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is confirmed through gel filtration chromatography and further characterized by crosslinking experiments identifying specific residues within PPIB that interact with PD4 and CRTAP (Wu2019Characterization). The interaction sites on PPIB crucial for binding to PD4 and CRTAP are mapped using mass spectrometry, highlighting the importance of specific residues in these protein-protein interactions (Wu2019Characterization).

Additionally, pathological mutations in PPIB, such as Gly6Arg and Gly137Asp, disrupt its ability to interact within the P3H1 ternary complex, affecting the complex's function in procollagen folding and potentially leading to diseases like osteogenesis imperfecta due to collagen misfolding (Wu2019Characterization).

These interactions underscore the multifunctional role of PPIB in cellular regulation, impacting not only protein folding but also the stability and function of multiprotein complexes crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and function.
