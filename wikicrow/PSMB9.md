# PSMB9

## Overview
PSMB9 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 9, a component of the immunoproteasome complex distinct from the standard proteasome. This subunit is crucial for the degradation of oxidized and damaged proteins, particularly under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cellular proteostasis (Kim2023Immunoproteasome-specific). The immunoproteasome, including PSMB9, is involved in generating peptides for MHC class I antigen presentation, essential for immune surveillance and response. It also plays a significant role in the selective degradation of damaged proteins, enhancing the degradation efficiency of specific substrates under stress conditions (Kim2023Immunoproteasome-specific; Kim2021Protein). PSMB9's function and interactions are pivotal in cellular defense mechanisms, immune response, and potentially in various clinical contexts including autoimmune diseases and cancer.

## Function
PSMB9 encodes a subunit of the immunoproteasome, a specialized form of the proteasome that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular proteostasis, particularly under stress conditions such as mitochondrial dysfunction. This subunit is involved in the degradation of oxidized and damaged proteins, a process that is vital for coping with proteotoxic stress in ATP-depleting conditions (Kim2023Immunoproteasome-specific). The immunoproteasome, including PSMB9, preferentially degrades proteins that are oxidized, operating in an ATP-independent manner (Kim2023Immunoproteasome-specific).

Originally, the primary function of the immunoproteasome was thought to be in generating peptides for MHC class I antigen presentation. However, it has since been shown that the immunoproteasome, with its distinct structural features and cleavage specificities compared to the standard proteasome, also plays a significant role in the selective degradation of damaged proteins. PSMB9, in particular, preferentially cleaves after hydrophobic residues, enhancing the degradation efficiency of specific substrates under stress conditions (Kim2023Immunoproteasome-specific; Kim2021Protein).

The immunoproteasome, including PSMB9, replaces the constitutive catalytic Î² subunits of the standard proteasome under certain conditions, such as cellular stress or immune response activation, thereby playing a crucial role in processing antigens for presentation on MHC class I molecules, essential for immune surveillance and response (Kim2023Immunoproteasome-specific). This activity underscores the importance of PSMB9 in both the immune response and the maintenance of cellular health under stress.

## Clinical Significance
PSMB9 mutations and alterations in its expression have been implicated in a variety of diseases, particularly those involving immune dysregulation and increased cancer risk. A novel type I interferonopathy, characterized by symptoms such as fever, skin rashes, and severe pulmonary hypertension, has been linked to a de novo mutation in the PSMB9 gene. This mutation results in reduced proteasome activity, leading to hyperactivation of the interferon-alpha pathway, which is critical in immune response regulation (Kataoka2021Successful). 

In the context of cancer, PSMB9 has been associated with melanoma risk. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PSMB9 gene have been shown to influence its expression levels, which may increase susceptibility to melanoma. The SNP rs2071480, in particular, affects transcription factor binding and is linked to higher PSMB9 mRNA expression in melanoma tissues compared to normal skin (Qian2013Association).

Furthermore, PSMB9 expression is upregulated in the skin of patients with dermatomyositis (DM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diseases known for their autoimmune components. This upregulation is induced by interferon, which plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of these conditions, suggesting that PSMB9 could be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target (Nakamura2016The). 

These findings underscore the clinical significance of PSMB9 in both immune system disorders and cancer, highlighting its role in disease pathogenesis and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
PSMB9, also known as LMP2, interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular proteostasis and immune response mechanisms. One notable interaction is with the matrix protein (M) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This interaction, identified using yeast two-hybrid assays and coimmunoprecipitation, involves the globular domain of the M protein and the inactive precursor form of LMP2. Specific mutations in M (I96A) and LMP2 (L45R and D17A) impair this interaction, suggesting a precise binding interface that is critical for the interaction's biological relevance (Beilstein2015Characterization).

In the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, PSMB9 interacts with molecular chaperones like HSPB1 to enhance proteasome activity, crucial for degrading misfolded proteins that accumulate under stress conditions. This interaction helps in maintaining cellular proteostasis by facilitating the transfer of aggregation-prone proteins to the proteasome for degradation (Kim2023Immunoproteasome-specific). Additionally, proximity ligation assays have shown that PSMB9 physically interacts with mitochondrial proteins, specifically with the mitochondrial complex II subunit SDHA, indicating a role in managing proteotoxic stress within mitochondrial contexts (Kim2023Immunoproteasome-specific). These interactions underscore the multifunctional role of PSMB9 in cellular defense mechanisms and stress responses.
