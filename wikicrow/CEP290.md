# CEP290

## Overview
CEP290, officially known as centrosomal protein 290, is a gene that encodes the protein centrosomal protein 290, which is integral to the structure and function of centrosomes and cilia in eukaryotic cells. The protein itself is a large, coiled-coil structure that plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, essential organelles for cell signaling and sensory functions. Mutations in the CEP290 gene are associated with a variety of genetic disorders, particularly affecting sensory systems such as vision and kidney function. The protein interacts with multiple other proteins and is involved in complex pathways that maintain cellular architecture and signaling integrity. CEP290's involvement in disease and its fundamental role in cell biology make it a significant focus of genetic and molecular research (Coppieters2010CEP290; Drivas2014CEP290).

## Structure
CEP290, or centrosomal protein 290, is a large protein primarily structured into coiled-coils throughout its length, with about 60% of its residues forming these structures. It contains several putative protein motifs and domains, including three tropomyosin homology domains, a structural maintenance of chromosomes homology domain, a large hook domain, a myosin-tail homology domain, numerous kinase-inducible domains, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal (Coppieters2010CEP290; Drivas2014CEP290). The protein also displays high similarity to myosin and contains a partial structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) conserved domain (Coppieters2010CEP290).

CEP290 has been shown to interact with itself, suggesting potential for dimerization and the formation of long filaments through various homotypic interactions between its N- and C-termini, which can bind each other. This indicates a complex tertiary and quaternary structure (Drivas2014CEP290). Predicted motifs in CEP290 suggest potential modifications such as N-glycosylation, tyrosine sulfation, and phosphorylation (Coppieters2010CEP290). The protein has multiple isoforms, as indicated by the presence of alternatively spliced transcripts observed in lymphocytes and low molecular mass bands in bovine retinal extracts (Coppieters2010CEP290).

## Function
CEP290, or centrosomal protein 290, is a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia and centrosomes, which are crucial for cell signaling and division. The protein is composed of nearly 2500 amino acids and includes various domains such as tropomyosin homology domains, a structural maintenance of chromosomes homology domain, and a nuclear localization signal, suggesting its involvement in multiple cellular compartments and processes (Drivas2014CEP290).

In healthy cells, CEP290 is localized to the centrioles and pericentriolar material, where it is essential for ciliogenesis. This involves the activation of CEP290 upon the degradation of the inhibitory protein CP110, leading to the growth of the ciliary axoneme and the formation of the primary cilium (Drivas2014CEP290). Additionally, CEP290 plays a significant role in the regulation of transport into and out of the ciliary compartment, a process essential for maintaining the ciliary structure and function (Drivas2014CEP290).

Mutations in CEP290 have been linked to a variety of human diseases, indicating its essential role in healthy cellular function. The proper function of CEP290 is critical for the maintenance of photoreceptor cells, which are highly specialized sensory neurons essential for vision. Disruptions in CEP290 function can lead to early-onset retinal degeneration due to altered interactions with other ciliary and centrosomal proteins (Chang2006In-frame).

## Clinical Significance
CEP290 mutations are linked to a spectrum of genetic disorders, primarily affecting the eyes, kidneys, and neurological systems. These conditions are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and include Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS), and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). JSRD, particularly the oculo-renal form known as JSRD-SLS, is significantly associated with CEP290 mutations, with these mutations found in a substantial percentage of affected individuals (Brancati2007CEP290). LCA, a severe retinal dystrophy leading to early-onset blindness, is another major condition caused by mutations in CEP290, with certain mutations like c.2991+1655A>G being particularly prevalent (Littink2010A; Sheck2018Leber).

The clinical manifestations of CEP290 mutations are diverse, ranging from isolated eye conditions to multi-systemic disorders. This variability is partly due to the gene's role in ciliary function, as CEP290 is a ciliary protein involved in multiple organ systems. The presence of modifier alleles in other ciliary genes can also influence the phenotypic outcomes of CEP290 mutations, complicating genotype-phenotype correlations (Coppieters2010CEP290).

Despite the identification of numerous mutations, the clinical outcomes associated with specific CEP290 mutations can vary widely, even among individuals with the same mutation, indicating the influence of other genetic or environmental factors (Coppieters2010CEP290). This complexity underscores the challenges in predicting disease manifestations based solely on genetic diagnosis and highlights the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders.

## Interactions
CEP290 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a crucial role in ciliogenesis and the structural integrity of cilia. It is involved in forming a diffusion barrier at the transition zone of cilia, potentially in conjunction with Y-linkers, and interacts with components of the BBSome, a complex involved in transporting membrane proteins to the cilium, such as MKKS and BBS4 (Rachel2015CEP290). Additionally, CEP290 is essential for tethering transition zone microtubules to the membrane, interacting with proteins like CEP164, CCDC41, and RPGR, which is implicated in inherited retinal degeneration (Rachel2015CEP290).

CEP290 also forms complexes with centrosomal and microtubule-associated proteins including RPGR-interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1), dynactin subunits, kinesin subunit KIF3A, and others, but does not associate with nucleophosmin or Nephrocystin-5 (Chang2006In-frame). In the context of nephrocystin proteins, CEP290 interacts with NPHP5 to regulate BBSome integrity and facilitate the trafficking of specific membrane cargos like VPAC2 and Rab8a to cilia (Barbelanne2014Nephrocystin). These interactions underscore CEP290's multifunctional nature and its involvement in complex genetic regulation within cellular structures like cilia and centrosomes.
