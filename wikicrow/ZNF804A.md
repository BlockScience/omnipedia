# ZNF804A

## Overview
ZNF804A is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein zinc finger protein 804A, characterized by its C2H2-type zinc-finger domain. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression within the central nervous system. Zinc finger protein 804A is involved in various cellular processes including neurite outgrowth, synaptic structure, and neuronal connectivity, which are essential for normal brain development and function. The gene and its protein product are of significant interest due to their association with neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, where mutations or variations in ZNF804A have been linked to disease susceptibility and phenotype expression (Chang2017The; Aabdien2021Schizophrenia).

## Function
ZNF804A, a gene encoding a protein with a C2H2-type zinc-finger domain, plays a crucial role in various molecular and cellular processes in the brain. This protein is implicated in transcriptional regulation, potentially acting as a transcription factor that binds DNA and regulates gene expression. It is expressed in both undifferentiated human neural progenitor cells and differentiated neurons, indicating its involvement from early neuronal development through to mature neuronal functions (Deans2017Psychosis).

In the context of neurodevelopment, ZNF804A is essential for neurite outgrowth and the structural development of neurons. Knockdown experiments have shown that reduced expression of ZNF804A leads to significant decreases in neurite length, underscoring its importance in neuritogenesis (Deans2017Psychosis). Additionally, ZNF804A regulates the expression of NLGN4, a protein involved in neurite outgrowth and synaptic density, further highlighting its role in synaptic structure and function (Deans2017Psychosis).

At the synaptic level, ZNF804A localizes to dendrites and synapses, particularly within dendritic spines, where it is involved in spine maintenance and structural plasticity. This localization supports its function in regulating synaptic density and response to synaptic activity, crucial for proper neuronal connectivity and brain function (Deans2017Psychosis).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF804A has been identified as a significant genetic factor in the susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Variations in this gene, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706, have been linked to these psychiatric disorders across various populations. This SNP is associated with altered brain function and structure, influencing cognitive functions and possibly contributing to the broader spectrum of social cognition (Chang2017The). 

Research indicates that the risk allele of rs1344706 is correlated with decreased mRNA levels during fetal brain development, which may affect the expression of alternatively spliced ZNF804A transcripts. These changes in gene expression are thought to impact synaptic and neurodevelopmental genes, potentially leading to the observed clinical features in schizophrenia patients (Chapman2018Convergent). 

Furthermore, ZNF804A is implicated in the regulation of genes involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission, such as dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which are directly associated with schizophrenia (Huang2016A). The gene's variations have also been studied in relation to anxiety disorders and autism spectrum disorders, suggesting a broader impact on psychiatric phenotypes (Deans2017Psychosis). 

Overall, the clinical significance of ZNF804A in psychiatric disorders underscores its role in brain structure and function, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ZNF804A, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation and neurodevelopment. Notably, ZNF804A interacts with STAT2, a transcription factor involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This interaction, which occurs at the N-terminus of ZNF804A, facilitates the translocation of the complex into the nucleus upon stimulation with interferon IFN2Î±, influencing gene transcription (Klockmeier2021Schizophrenia). Additionally, ZNF804A forms complexes with several proteins that impact neurite outgrowth and synaptic functions, such as LGALS1 and FEZ1. LGALS1 is particularly effective in rescuing deficits induced by ZNF804A knockdown, highlighting the functional significance of these interactions in neuronal development (Dong2021Schizophrenia).

ZNF804A also interacts with various proteins involved in mRNA translation, such as RPSA, and is part of ribonucleoprotein complexes associated with polyribosomes, indicating a role in translational regulation (Zhou2017Interactome). Furthermore, it has been shown to interact with NT5C2, a protein enriched in synaptic regions, suggesting a role in synaptic function and localization (Aabdien2021Schizophrenia). These interactions underline the multifaceted role of ZNF804A in cellular processes critical for brain function and development.
