# NPPB

## Overview
The NPPB gene, located on chromosome 1 in humans, encodes the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a critical hormone in cardiovascular physiology. BNP is primarily synthesized and secreted by the cardiac ventricles in response to ventricular volume expansion and pressure overload. The gene's product, BNP, is a 32-amino acid polypeptide that arises from the cleavage of a 108-amino acid prohormone, proBNP, and plays a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure, sodium balance, and fluid homeostasis. BNP functions by binding to natriuretic peptide receptors, leading to vasodilatory, natriuretic, and diuretic effects, which are essential for cardiovascular health and disease management. The gene and its protein product are also involved in pathophysiological conditions such as heart failure and hypertension, making them significant targets for therapeutic intervention (Goetze2020Cardiac; Mair2008Biochemistry).

## Structure
The NPPB gene encodes the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which plays a crucial role in cardiovascular physiology. The primary structure of BNP includes a preprohormone of 134 amino acids, which undergoes cleavage to form the active hormone and other functional peptides. The mature BNP hormone consists of a 32-amino acid peptide, which is derived from the cleavage of a 108-amino acid prohormone, proBNP. This cleavage specifically occurs between amino acid residues 76 and 77 (Mair2008Biochemistry; Mair2009Clinical).

BNP is characterized by a 17-amino acid ring structure formed by a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues, crucial for its receptor binding and biological activity (Mair2008Biochemistry). The molecular structure of BNP also includes a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain in some of its splice variant isoforms, such as ÎE2-NPPB, which lacks exon 2 leading to a frameshift and a unique peptide sequence (Torrado2010Exon-skipping).

Post-translational modifications of BNP and its precursors include glycosylation, which affects the molecular weight and stability of the peptides in circulation. Identified glycosylation sites in proBNP include Thr36, Ser37, Ser44, Thr48, Ser53, Thr58, and Thr71 (Mair2009Clinical). These modifications are essential for the function and regulation of the peptides derived from proBNP.

Overall, the molecular structure and post-translational modifications of BNP and its variants are critical for their physiological roles and implications in cardiovascular health.

## Function
The NPPB gene encodes the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a hormone primarily secreted by the heart's ventricles in response to stretching caused by increased blood volume. BNP plays a critical role in cardiovascular homeostasis by promoting natriuresis, the excretion of sodium through urine, and diuresis, which is the increased production of urine. These actions collectively contribute to the reduction of blood volume and blood pressure, crucial for maintaining heart function and preventing conditions such as heart failure (Goetze2020Cardiac).

BNP is synthesized as a preprohormone (preproBNP), which is then cleaved to form proBNP. Further enzymatic action converts proBNP into the active hormone BNP and the inactive N-terminal fragment, NT-proBNP. The processing of proBNP involves specific post-translational modifications such as O-glycosylation, which are essential for the maturation and secretion of the hormone (Goetze2020Cardiac; Del2011Genome-wide).

In the cellular context, BNP secretion is stimulated by factors like atrial muscle stretch and involves mechanisms such as Gq-coupled receptor signaling. The presence of specific granules in atrial cardiomyocytes also plays a role in the storage and stimulus-triggered release of BNP (Goetze2020Cardiac).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPPB gene, which encodes the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), have significant clinical implications in cardiovascular health. A novel mutation in the 5'-flanking region of the NPPB gene has been associated with hereditary malignant hypertension and reduced sensitivity to the antihypertensive drug sodium nitroprusside. Patients with this mutation exhibit higher mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure, as well as altered responses to hypertension treatment compared to those without such mutations (Zeng2012Impact). Additionally, polymorphisms like rs198389 in the NPPB promoter region have been linked to variations in BNP levels, influencing blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Individuals with the GG genotype of rs198389 have higher levels of NT-proBNP and are associated with lower blood pressure, reduced hypertension incidence, and decreased cardiovascular mortality (Rubattu2019Molecular; Seidelmann2017An). Furthermore, elevated BNP levels, influenced by genetic variations in NPPB, are associated with improved outcomes in conditions such as heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus, highlighting the gene's role in disease prognosis and management (Guan2020Potential).

## Interactions
NPPB, encoded by the natriuretic peptide B gene, is involved in crucial cardiovascular interactions, primarily through its product, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). BNP interacts with the natriuretic peptide receptor, which mediates effects such as diuresis, vasodilation, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, essential for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. The research also highlights the transcriptional regulation of NPPB by SHOX2, a transcription factor that activates NPPB expression more effectively than SHOX. This activation is demonstrated using a luciferase assay in U2OS cells, where cells overexpressing SHOX2 were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the NPPB promoter (Aza-Carmona2014NPPB). However, mutations in SHOX2, specifically p.L155V and p.Q234X, impair its ability to activate the NPPB promoter, suggesting that these mutations disrupt the functional interaction between SHOX2 and the NPPB gene in this regulatory capacity (Aza-Carmona2014NPPB). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory mechanisms that control NPPB expression and its subsequent physiological roles, highlighting the gene's significance in both skeletal and cardiovascular development.
