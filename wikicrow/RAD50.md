# RAD50

## Overview
RAD50 is a gene located on chromosome 5q31.1 that encodes the RAD50 double strand break repair protein, a key component of the MRN complex involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks (DSBs). The RAD50 protein is characterized by its structural features, including a coiled-coil domain and ATPase activity, which are crucial for its function in DNA repair mechanisms such as homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. This protein plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the detection, signaling, and repair of DSBs, as well as mediating cellular checkpoint responses to prevent the progression of the cell cycle in the presence of DNA damage. The importance of RAD50 extends beyond its cellular functions, as mutations in this gene are associated with various clinical outcomes, including cancer susceptibility and rare genetic disorders (Djuzenova2004Normal; DâAmours2002The).

## Structure
The RAD50 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure essential for its role in DNA repair. It features a long coiled-coil domain that spans approximately 600-900 amino acids, connecting two globular ATPase domains located at the N- and C-termini (Zabolotnaya2020Turning). These ATPase domains contain the Walker A and Walker B motifs, crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Kinoshita2009RAD50; Zabolotnaya2020Turning). The coiled-coil domain bends at a centrally located 'zinc-hook' motif, which is shorter compared to other SMC proteins and consists of about thirty amino acids (Zabolotnaya2020Turning). This zinc-hook, containing a cysteine-rich, zinc-coordinating motif (CXXC), is vital for the dimerization of RAD50 molecules, facilitating the formation of tetrameric structures and potentially higher-order assemblies crucial for chromosomal bridging during DNA repair events (Zabolotnaya2020Turning; Hohl2011The).

The RAD50 protein undergoes significant conformational changes upon ATP binding and hydrolysis. These changes transition the protein from flexible, ring-shaped arrangements to more rigid, rod-like structures, which are critical for its function in processes such as double-strand break repair (Zabolotnaya2020Turning). The dynamic nature of these transformations allows RAD50 to collaborate effectively within the MR complex, particularly with Mre11, to maintain genomic stability and respond to DNA damage (Beikzadeh2021The).

## Function
RAD50 is a crucial component of the MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1), which plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), a common form of DNA damage. The RAD50 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the repair of these breaks through both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. RAD50, along with MRE11 and NBS1, forms a complex that detects DSBs and initiates repair by signaling to other cellular machinery and stabilizing the DNA around the break site (Djuzenova2004Normal; DâAmours2002The).

The protein is characterized by a coiled-coil structure and an ATP-binding domain, which are critical for its function in DNA repair. The ATP-binding domain undergoes conformational changes that are essential for the activation of the complex's DNA repair functions (DâAmours2002The). RAD50's structural similarity to SMC proteins, which are involved in chromosome condensation and sister-chromatid cohesion, underscores its role in maintaining genomic integrity (DâAmours2002The).

In the nucleus, RAD50's function is not only pivotal in directly repairing DNA but also in mediating the cellular checkpoint responses that prevent the cell cycle from progressing when DNA damage is present. This checkpoint function is crucial to prevent the propagation of damaged DNA, which can lead to genomic instability and potentially cancer (Petrini1999The). Thus, RAD50 is integral to both the repair of DNA damage and the broader cellular mechanisms that maintain genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAD50 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer susceptibility and rare genetic disorders. RAD50 mutations are associated with poorer survival outcomes in breast cancer patients who are negative for BRCA1/2 mutations, indicating its role in tumor progression and prognosis (Fan2018RAD50). Additionally, RAD50 germline mutations have been linked to breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, suggesting a potential role in hereditary cancer predisposition (Heikkinen2003Mutation).

Beyond cancer, RAD50 mutations lead to a distinctive clinical phenotype known as RAD50 deficiency. This condition is characterized by congenital microcephaly, postnatal short stature, mild learning disabilities, and normal sexual development, without the severe neurological symptoms or neurodegeneration seen in similar disorders (Ragamin2020Human). This highlights the critical role of RAD50 in maintaining genomic stability and proper DNA repair mechanisms.

In the context of cancer therapy, RAD50 mutations have been identified as potential biomarkers for predicting responses to treatments like PARP inhibitors, suggesting that RAD50 could serve as a target for enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatments (Bian2019MRE11-RAD50-NBS1). Furthermore, specific RAD50 mutations have been exploited for synthetic lethality in cancer therapy, providing a basis for targeted treatment strategies in tumors with defective DNA repair capabilities (Al-Ahmadie2014Synthetic). These findings underscore the diverse and significant impact of RAD50 mutations on both disease development and therapeutic approaches.

## Interactions
RAD50, as part of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, plays a crucial role in DNA repair and replication. It undergoes ATP-dependent conformational changes that control the nuclease activity of Mre11 and ATM signaling (Lafrance-Vanasse2015Envisioning). The Rad50 protein interacts with DNA and other protein complexes, including transient and dynamic DNA binding facilitated by the Rad50 zinc-hook head tracking along the minor groove of DNA (Zabolotnaya2020Modes). This interaction is characterized by Coulombic interactions between the positively charged zinc ion at the Rad50 zinc-hook and the negatively charged sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA. Additionally, Rad50 interacts with other M/R complexes via the canonical intermolecular association of their Rad50 coiled-coil ends, forming 'Velcro-like' fastenings (Zabolotnaya2020Modes).

The RAD50 protein also features a distinctive 500 Ã-long coiled-coil terminating in a zinc-hook, which is critical for the protein's function in DNA repair by potentially bridging two DNA ends together during the repair process (Lafrance-Vanasse2015Envisioning). Mutations in the zinc-hook region affect RAD50's ability to interact with Mre11 and impair the MRN complex's recruitment and stability at chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs), crucially impacting the activation of ATM kinase and subsequent DNA repair pathways (Lafrance-Vanasse2015Envisioning).
