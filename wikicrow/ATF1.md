# ATF1

## Overview
ATF1, or Activating Transcription Factor 1, is a gene located in humans that encodes the protein of the same name, which functions as a transcription factor. The ATF1 protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by regulating gene expression in response to various physiological and stress-related signals. It is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, essential for DNA binding and dimerization, allowing it to interact with other transcription factors and coactivators to modulate gene expression dynamically (SansoÌ2008Transcription; Hai2001The). ATF1 is involved in several critical cellular pathways, including those activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and is implicated in the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of genes such as c-jun, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Gupta2002ATF1). Additionally, ATF1's role extends to interactions with proteins like BRCA1 and involvement in chromosomal translocations in certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Houvras2000BRCA1).

## Structure
The ATF1 protein, encoded by the ATF1 gene in humans, is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization. This domain is common among several transcription factors and is essential for the protein's function in transcriptional regulation (SansoÌ2008Transcription; Hai2001The). The molecular structure of ATF1 includes a DNA-binding domain (bZIP) and a transactivation domain, which are separated by an intermediate domain rich in positively charged amino acids. This arrangement suggests that phosphorylation of the transactivation domain, which contains multiple phosphorylation sites, does not impair the DNA-binding capacity of ATF1 but may enhance transcription initiation by facilitating the recruitment of other transcriptional machinery (Salat-Canela2017Deciphering).

ATF1 undergoes significant post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation, which plays a critical role in its functional regulation. The phosphorylation sites identified include Ser152, Ser172, Thr204, Thr216, Ser226, and Thr249, and mutations at these sites can render the protein inactive, highlighting their importance for ATF1's activity (Salat-Canela2017Deciphering).

While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ATF1 are not detailed in the provided excerpts, the information underscores the significance of the bZIP domain and phosphorylation in the protein's function and stability.

## Function
ATF1 (Activating Transcription Factor 1) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression in response to various cellular signals, including epidermal growth factor (EGF). It is involved in the signaling pathways activated by EGF, particularly focusing on the expression of the protooncogene c-jun. ATF1 is phosphorylated by the ERK MAPK pathway, a process essential for the EGF-induced expression of c-jun. This phosphorylation event is a critical step in the activation of the c-jun promoter, which is further influenced by the cooperation of the ERK and JNK pathways (Gupta2002ATF1).

In addition to its role in response to EGF, ATF1 also interacts with other transcription factors like CREB and is involved in the binding to coactivators such as the CREB-binding protein. This indicates its broader role in transcriptional regulation (Gupta2002ATF1). ATF1 can form homodimers or heterodimers with CREB, and both proteins are phosphorylated at conserved protein kinase A sites, which are also targets for phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases. This phosphorylation facilitates the interaction of CREB/ATF1 with transcriptional coactivators such as CBP and p300, enhancing their transcriptional activity (Houvras2000BRCA1).

ATF1 is also implicated in chromosomal translocations in certain cancers and may be targeted for mutation in some breast or ovarian cancers, similar to other proteins that interact with BRCA1, highlighting its significance in cellular health and disease (Houvras2000BRCA1).

## Clinical Significance
ATF1 (Activating Transcription Factor 1) is implicated in various cancers and other diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, and disruptions in its normal interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ATF1 is overexpressed and linked to the activation of genes involved in critical pathways such as apoptosis, Wnt, TGF-beta, and MAPK, which contribute to cell proliferation and tumor growth. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATF1 enhance its expression through promoter-enhancer interactions mediated by transcription factors SP1 and GATA3, predisposing individuals to CRC (Tian2019Systematic).

In the context of soft tissue tumors, ATF1 is part of the EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene found in clear cell sarcoma, acting as a tumor promoter by producing a chimeric protein that transactivates genes in a cAMP-independent manner, leading to dysregulation of genes controlled by CREB1/ATF and promoting the melanocytic phenotype and growth of tumor cells (Thway2012Tumors).

Furthermore, ATF1 has been associated with essential hypertension (EH) in the Northeastern Han Chinese population. A mutation in the ATF1 gene affects the binding of microRNAs, leading to altered expression levels and increasing the risk of EH (Yang2015The). These findings underscore the diverse roles of ATF1 in human diseases and highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
ATF1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cellular response mechanisms. One of the key interactions is with PIAS3, which modulates ATF1's activity by inhibiting its binding to the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) of the human ferritin H gene, thereby influencing gene expression (Iwasaki2007PIAS3). Additionally, ATF1 forms a complex with the APC/C ubiquitin ligase through Apc5 in fission yeast, which is crucial for the function of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase, enhancing its ubiquitylation activity (Ors2009The).

ATF1 also interacts with BRCA1 through the RING finger motif of BRCA1 and the basic zipper DNA-binding domain of ATF1. This interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of ATF1, particularly under conditions involving DNA damage (Houvras2000BRCA1). Furthermore, ATF1 is involved in stress response mechanisms where it interacts with Fbh1, part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Phosphorylation of ATF1, influenced by stress-induced activation of the Sty1 MAP kinase, modulates this interaction, crucial for regulating ATF1 levels under stress conditions (Lawrence2009Stress-Induced).

These interactions highlight ATF1's role in regulating various cellular processes through its involvement in multiple protein complexes and its ability to respond to cellular signals.
