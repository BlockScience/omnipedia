# XRCC6

## Overview
XRCC6, also known as Ku70, is a gene that encodes the protein X-ray repair cross complementing 6, which plays a pivotal role in the DNA repair process. This protein is a key component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, essential for repairing double-strand breaks in DNA, a critical function for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could lead to cancer. XRCC6 forms a heterodimer with XRCC5 (also known as Ku80), and this complex is fundamental in recognizing and binding to the broken ends of DNA, facilitating the subsequent repair steps. The protein's importance extends beyond DNA repair, as it also interacts with various proteins and participates in multiple cellular processes, including viral replication and the cellular response to stress (Bau2011Role; Thacker2003The).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the XRCC6 protein, also known as Ku70, is characterized by a three-domain topology. This includes an N-terminal Î±/Î² domain, a central Î²-barrel domain, and an Î±-helical C-terminal arm. These domains are crucial for the protein's function in DNA repair, particularly in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. The C-terminal domains of XRCC6 are specifically involved in DNA interaction, which is essential for the formation of the XRCC5/XRCC6/XRCC7 holoenzyme complex that repairs broken DNA ends (Bau2011Role).

In terms of secondary structure, XRCC6 features both Î±-helices and Î²-sheets, which are typical components of many protein structures. However, detailed descriptions of the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available sources. 

Specific domains within XRCC6 include the Ku core domain, which is involved in interactions with other proteins such as FOXL2. This interaction does not require the presence of DNA, highlighting the versatility and importance of the Ku core domain in protein-protein interactions (Jin2020FOXL2).

No information on common post-translational modifications, splice variant isoforms, or prominent folds within XRCC6 is available from the provided sources.

## Function
XRCC6, also known as Ku70, forms a crucial component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, a primary mechanism for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. These breaks can be particularly deleterious to cellular health and genomic stability. The XRCC5/XRCC6 dimer, known as Ku80/Ku70, is one of the initial responders to DSBs. It binds to the broken DNA ends, stabilizing them and facilitating the recruitment of additional repair proteins such as XRCC7 (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit), which are essential for the repair process (Bau2011Role; Thacker2003The).

This interaction is critical for maintaining genomic integrity, especially during the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle when NHEJ is predominantly active. Deficiencies in NHEJ, including disruptions in XRCC6 function, can lead to increased genomic instability and contribute to tumorigenesis (Bau2011Role). Additionally, the XRCC6 protein, along with XRCC5, is involved in the formation of a complex that performs the critical function of repairing the broken DNA ends, which is vital for preventing the accumulation of genetic damage and maintaining overall cellular health (Bau2011Role).

## Clinical Significance
XRCC6, also known as Ku70, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in DNA repair. Mutations or polymorphisms in XRCC6 are associated with altered cancer susceptibility. For instance, the Ku70 C-61G polymorphism is linked to increased incidence of breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, and lung cancer (Sishc2017The). Another polymorphism, Ku70 promoter T-991C, is associated with higher risks of hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, oral cancer, renal cancer, and nasopharyngeal cancer (Sishc2017The; Jia2015Association). Additionally, the XRCC6 A46922G polymorphism is protective against breast carcinogenesis but increases the risk of other unspecified cancers (Sishc2017The).

Specifically, the XRCC6 promoter T-991C polymorphism significantly influences the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with altered mRNA and protein expression levels observed in affected individuals (Huang2015The). Moreover, the XRCC6 C1310G polymorphism has been shown to increase cancer risk, particularly in Asian populations, affecting genomic stability and thereby influencing cancer development (Jiang2012Quantitative).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of XRCC6 in cancer susceptibility, highlighting its potential as a target for personalized medicine and therapy in various cancers.

## Interactions
XRCC6, also known as Ku70, forms a heterodimer with Ku80, which is crucial for its role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. This heterodimer binds to DNA ends, facilitating the alignment and ligation of DNA during repair processes (Walker2001Structure; Bau2011Role). The Ku heterodimer also interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to form a complex essential for detecting and repairing double-strand breaks in DNA (Hammel2021Xâray; Spagnolo2006Three-Dimensional).

Additionally, XRCC6 has been identified as a binding partner of the adenovirus protein E1A. This interaction, particularly through the CR4 region of E1A, is significant for viral replication and the cellular response to viral infection. The binding of E1A to XRCC6 influences various cellular processes, including the cell cycle and DNA damage response pathways, which are crucial during adenovirus infection (Frost2017The).

These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of XRCC6 in both DNA repair and the regulation of cellular responses to viral infections, underscoring its importance in cellular stability and integrity.
