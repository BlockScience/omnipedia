# CXCR4

## Overview
CXCR4, officially known as C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4, is a protein encoded by the CXCR4 gene in humans. This receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by its structure that includes seven transmembrane domains. CXCR4 primarily functions as a receptor for the chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1, which plays a critical role in the homing of hematopoietic cells to the bone marrow and in various other processes including embryonic development and angiogenesis. The interaction between CXCR4 and its ligand is also pivotal in the pathophysiology of several diseases, including HIV infection and cancer, making it a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Choi2011Biology; Chatterjee2014The). As a transmembrane receptor, CXCR4 is involved in complex signaling pathways that regulate cell migration, survival, and proliferation, underscoring its importance in both normal physiological and pathological conditions (Pawig2015Diversity; Scala2020New).

## Structure
CXCR4, a chemokine receptor encoded by the CXCR4 gene, is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane (TM) helical structure. This receptor's molecular architecture includes an extracellular N-terminus, seven transmembrane alpha helices, three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and a cytoplasmic C-terminus. Notably, the extracellular end of helix VII extends two helical turns longer than in other GPCRs, which is crucial for forming a disulfide bond with the N-terminal region, essential for ligand binding (Pawig2015Diversity; Wu2010Structures).

The receptor's quaternary structure reveals that CXCR4 can form homodimers, primarily involving helices V and VI, which may influence its signaling mechanisms (Wu2010Structures). Additionally, CXCR4 has been shown to dimerize with ACKR3 and other receptors, suggesting a versatile role in cellular signaling pathways (Pawig2015Diversity).

Post-translational modifications of CXCR4 include the sulfation of tyrosine residues in its extracellular N-terminal domain, which are critical for high-affinity ligand binding (Veldkamp2008Structural). These modifications, along with the receptor's ability to form dimers, are significant as they may influence CXCR4's ligand-binding properties and functional selectivity (Cutolo2016Interaction).

## Function
CXCR4, encoded by the CXCR4 gene, is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes by binding to its natural ligand, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), also known as CXCL12. This interaction is crucial for the migration and homing of hematopoietic stem cells to the bone marrow, a process essential for the maintenance and regeneration of the blood system (Majka page 0 of 1). CXCR4 is also involved in directing the migration of neurons during cerebellar development, influencing the proper formation of neuronal layers and contributing to the overall architecture of the cerebellum (Ma1998Impaired).

In the immune system, CXCR4 facilitates the migration and activation of leukocytes, playing a significant role in immune surveillance and inflammatory responses. The receptor's expression on various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages, underscores its importance in modulating immune responses (Choi2011Biology). Additionally, CXCR4 is implicated in organogenesis and vascularization, indicating its broader role in developmental processes beyond the immune and hematopoietic systems (Furusato2009CXCR4).

The CXCR4-SDF-1 axis is not only vital for physiological processes but also has implications in disease states, such as cancer and HIV, where it can influence tumor growth and viral entry into cells (Chatterjee2014The). Thus, CXCR4 is a critical molecular player in both health and disease, mediating essential cellular functions through its chemokine receptor activity.

## Clinical Significance
CXCR4 mutations are significantly implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and immunodeficiency disorders. In WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia (WM), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, mutations in the CXCR4 gene, such as the S338X mutation, are prevalent and associated with resistance to treatments like ibrutinib. These mutations lead to altered receptor signaling, enhancing cell survival and contributing to treatment resistance (Kaiser2020CXCR4; Cao2014CXCR4; Cao2014The). Similarly, in other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, CXCR4 mutations are linked to disease progression and poor response to chemotherapy (Scala2020New).

CXCR4 is also central to the pathogenesis of WHIM syndrome, a rare congenital immunodeficiency disorder. Mutations in CXCR4 in WHIM syndrome lead to aberrant receptor function, resulting in symptoms like warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (Cao2014CXCR4).

In the context of cancer, high CXCR4 expression is associated with poor prognosis across various cancers, including colorectal cancer and glioblastoma, due to its role in promoting metastasis and tumor growth (Scala2020New). The CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling axis is crucial in these processes, influencing tumor microenvironment dynamics and resistance mechanisms in cancer cells (Scala2020New).

## Interactions
CXCR4 interacts with a variety of proteins that modulate its function in cellular signaling and trafficking. Filamin A binds to CXCR4, stabilizing it at the plasma membrane and inhibiting its endocytosis (Fumagalli2019CXCR4/ACKR3). The E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 targets CXCR4 for ubiquitination and degradation, an interaction enhanced by phosphorylation at Ser 324/325 mediated by GRK6 upon CXCL12 activation (Fumagalli2019CXCR4/ACKR3). Î²-arrestin regulates CXCR4-mediated signaling and receptor internalization, with its interaction dependent on the C-terminal 34 amino acids of CXCR4 (Cheng2000Î²-Arrestin). This protein also interacts with Toll-like receptor 2 in human monocytes, modulated by Pg-fimbria from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Fumagalli2019CXCR4/ACKR3). Additionally, CXCR4 forms complexes with CD74, which are involved in AKT activation (Fumagalli2019CXCR4/ACKR3), and with CD164 in the presence of CXCL12, participating in the activation of AKT and PKCÎ¶ (Fumagalli2019CXCR4/ACKR3). The interaction with the HIV protein gp120 is critical for HIV entry into T-cells, highlighting CXCR4's role in viral pathogenesis (Pawig2015Diversity). These interactions underscore the multifaceted roles of CXCR4 in cellular communication and immune responses.
