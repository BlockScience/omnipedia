# NR1H4

## Overview
The NR1H4 gene encodes the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 4 (NR1H4), commonly known as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). This receptor is a key regulator of bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism, functioning as a ligand-activated transcription factor predominantly expressed in the liver, intestines, and kidneys. FXR is categorized as a nuclear receptor and plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by regulating the expression of genes involved in the synthesis, transport, and detoxification of bile acids and other metabolic processes. The protein's ability to bind to specific DNA sequences allows it to modulate the transcription of target genes, thereby influencing a wide range of physiological functions and protecting against metabolic disorders (Briz2014NR1H4; Koutsounas2015Farnesoid).

## Structure
The NR1H4 gene encodes the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a protein that plays a crucial role in bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis. FXR is structured typically like other nuclear receptors, featuring a modular domain architecture that includes a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Briz2014NR1H4).

The DBD of FXR contains two zinc finger motifs essential for DNA binding and dimerization with RXRÎ±, a common feature among nuclear receptors. This domain is highly conserved and crucial for base-specific interactions and receptor dimerization (Weikum2018The). The LBD is described as an allosteric signaling domain with a structure that includes 11 alpha-helices and 4 beta-strands, forming a hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket. This domain's variability allows NRs to recognize diverse ligands and includes an activation function surface (AF-2) that interacts with coregulator proteins (Weikum2018The).

A hinge region connects the DBD to the LBD and includes an insert of the amino acid sequence MYTG in the FXRÎ±1/2(+) isoforms, which may influence the flexibility and function of the receptor (Briz2014NR1H4).

FXR exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which differ at the N-terminus and in the inclusion of certain amino acid segments, affecting the protein's function and tissue distribution (Briz2014NR1H4). These structural features are critical for the protein's function in regulating gene expression through interactions with DNA and ligands.

## Function
The NR1H4 gene encodes the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of bile acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis. FXR functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor, primarily expressed in the liver, intestines, and kidneys, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in these metabolic pathways. Upon activation by bile acids, FXR binds to specific DNA sequences known as FXR response elements, modulating the transcription of target genes such as those involved in bile acid synthesis, transport, and detoxification (Briz2014NR1H4; Koutsounas2015Farnesoid).

FXR is crucial for maintaining bile acid homeostasis by mediating negative feedback mechanisms that control bile acid synthesis and detoxification. It also plays a role in protecting hepatocytes and enterocytes from excessive bile acid toxicity by inducing the expression of bile acid transporters and binding proteins (Stepanov2022The). Additionally, FXR influences lipid and glucose metabolism by regulating genes involved in cholesterol catabolism and gluconeogenesis (Koutsounas2015Farnesoid).

Beyond its metabolic functions, FXR contributes to intestinal health by maintaining the barrier function and controlling bacterial growth, thus preventing bacterial translocation and inflammation (Attinkara2012Association). This multifaceted role underscores FXR's importance in cellular function and overall metabolic homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NR1H4 gene, which encodes the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), are linked to several severe liver diseases, most notably progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). PFIC is characterized by early-onset liver dysfunction, neonatal cholestasis, and severe complications such as liver failure and coagulopathy. Specific mutations, including nonsense mutations and in-frame insertions, result in truncated or non-functional FXR protein, leading to a lack of detectable FXR protein expression in liver tissues (Gomez-Ospina2016Mutations). These genetic alterations correlate with severe clinical manifestations and often necessitate liver transplantation in early childhood (Gomez-Ospina2016Mutations).

Beyond PFIC, NR1H4 mutations have been associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), a condition marked by elevated liver enzymes and increased serum total bile acid, leading to risks such as preterm delivery and stillbirth (Lai2022Identification). Additionally, NR1H4 is implicated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where its expression influences key cell cycle proteins and signaling pathways, affecting disease progression and patient prognosis (Huang2022Clinical).

These findings underscore the critical role of NR1H4 in maintaining liver health and its broader implications in other severe conditions, highlighting the importance of genetic screening and targeted therapies in affected individuals.

## Interactions
NR1H4, also known as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), engages in various physical interactions crucial for its function as a transcription factor. It forms complexes with other nuclear receptors and can bind to DNA as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers, interacting with DNA elements oriented as palindromes, direct repeats, or everted repeats (Amoutzias2007A). The dimerization involves two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD), where the LBD initiates dimer formation in solution, and the DBD restricts receptors to binding their specific hormone response elements on the DNA (Amoutzias2007A).

NR1H4 also interacts with autophagy-related genes by binding to their promoter regions and suppressing their transcription, which negatively impacts cilia formation (Liu2018Ciliogenesis). This suppression of autophagy by NR1H4 is a critical aspect of its role in regulating cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and metabolism. Additionally, NR1H4's interaction with PPARA (another gene involved in these processes) shows that NR1H4 activity can repress PPARA-induced ciliogenesis by regulating autophagy (Liu2018Ciliogenesis). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving NR1H4 in cellular homeostasis and response to metabolic changes.
