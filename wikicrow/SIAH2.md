# SIAH2

## Overview
SIAH2 is a gene located in humans that encodes the protein siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a cellular mechanism for controlling protein degradation. Siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of protein stability, signal transduction, and cellular stress responses. It is particularly significant in mediating the cellular response to hypoxia by regulating hypoxia-inducible factors and has been implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its role in tumor suppression and cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions (Nakayama2009The; Nakayama2004Siah2). The protein's function and interaction with other proteins make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases where protein degradation and signal transduction pathways are disrupted.

## Structure
The molecular structure of the SIAH2 protein, a human E3 ubiquitin ligase, is characterized by several distinct domains crucial for its function. The N-terminal region of SIAH2 includes a RING domain, essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity. Following the RING domain are two zinc finger motifs, ZnF1 and ZnF2, which coordinate zinc ions and are involved in protein-protein interactions. ZnF1 coordinates one zinc ion using residues C138, C145, H157, and C161, while ZnF2 coordinates another using C168, C175, H187, and H192. Both zinc fingers contain two short antiparallel beta-strands and one alpha-helix (Zhang2017The).

The C-terminal region of SIAH2 features a highly conserved substrate binding domain (SBD), which comprises two anti-parallel beta-sheets, each containing four strands. An additional strand links ZnF2 with the SBD, crucial for the protein's substrate interaction capabilities (Zhang2017The). The crystal structure of SIAH2 reveals that it forms a dimer in the asymmetric unit, mediated mainly by residues on beta6, beta7, and alpha3, indicating its quaternary structure (Zhang2017The).

These structural features are vital for the protein's role in ubiquitination and its involvement in various cellular processes, including the hypoxia response and tumor suppression.

## Function
SIAH2 (siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2) encodes a RING finger type ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes by regulating protein ubiquitination and degradation. This enzyme is particularly important in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, targeting specific proteins to control their levels and activity within the cell. SIAH2's ubiquitin ligase activity allows it to target various proteins, including nuclear transcription factors and signal transduction molecules, for degradation, thereby regulating cellular functions such as signaling and survival (Nakayama2009The).

One of the key roles of SIAH2 is in the cellular response to hypoxia. It regulates the stability of prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs), particularly PHD1 and PHD3, under low oxygen conditions. This regulation is crucial for controlling the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î±, a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis. By targeting PHD3 for degradation, SIAH2 increases the stability and activity of HIF-1Î± during hypoxia, facilitating cellular adaptations to oxygen-sensitive physiological processes (Nakayama2004Siah2).

Additionally, SIAH2 is involved in tumor suppression and progression, influencing pathways that affect tumorigenesis and metastasis. It has been shown to regulate the SPRY2/Ras and PHD3/HIF pathways, crucial in the progression of human cancers. The activity of SIAH2 is increased under hypoxic conditions, where it is phosphorylated by p38 and its mRNA is induced by the Akt pathway, enhancing its role in adapting to low oxygen environments and impacting tumor growth and metastasis (Nakayama2009The; Qi2008The).

## Clinical Significance
SIAH2, a gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in protein degradation pathways. In breast cancer, alterations in SIAH2 expression are associated with resistance to endocrine therapy. High levels of SIAH2, induced by estrogen receptors, correlate with sensitivity to tamoxifen, whereas low levels, often due to epidermal growth factor receptor activation, are linked to resistance (Jansen2008Downregulation). Furthermore, SIAH2 expression is notably higher in aggressive and recurrent breast cancers, serving as a predictive marker for sensitivity to 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment in ER-positive breast cancer cells (Knauer2015The).

In lung cancer, SIAH2 plays a critical role in the EGFR/RAS pathway, with its dysfunction contributing to tumor growth and proliferation. Targeting SIAH2 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy in non-small-cell lung cancers (Ahmed2008Effect). Additionally, increased SIAH2 expression has been observed in human lung cancer, particularly in more aggressive forms, and is linked to poor differentiation and increased tumor size (Moreno2015The).

In prostate cancer, SIAH2 influences the development of neuroendocrine tumors and is necessary for early-stage tumor development, as evidenced in mouse models (Qi2010Siah2-Dependent). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SIAH2 in cancer progression and highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SIAH2, a human E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that regulate protein stability and cellular processes. It forms a complex with early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) and zinc finger protein 521 (ZFP521) during early adipogenesis, facilitating the ubiquitylation and degradation of ZFP521 while increasing EBF1 protein levels, crucial for adipocyte differentiation (Dang2020SIAH2). Additionally, SIAH2 interacts with Sprouty (Spry) proteins, particularly Spry2, targeting them for proteasomal degradation. This interaction does not depend on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of Spry proteins, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism by SIAH2 in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (Nadeau2006Regulation). Furthermore, SIAH2 binds to prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), especially PHD3, targeting it for degradation, which is crucial for cellular responses to hypoxia (Nakayama2004Siah2). In the context of stress response, SIAH2 targets TRAF2 for ubiquitylation and degradation, modulating apoptosis and signal transduction under stress conditions (Habelhah2002Stress-induced). These interactions highlight SIAH2's role in various cellular processes through its interaction with multiple proteins, influencing pathways from adipogenesis and signal transduction to stress response and hypoxia.
