# KLKB1

## Overview
The KLKB1 gene, located on chromosome 4 in humans, encodes the plasma prekallikrein protein, a key component of the kallikrein-kinin system. This system plays a critical role in various physiological processes including blood coagulation, inflammation, and blood pressure regulation. The protein product, plasma kallikrein, is a serine protease that is involved in the cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen to release bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Plasma kallikrein also contributes to the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, which is essential for blood pressure homeostasis. The gene and its protein product are implicated in several clinical conditions, such as hypertension and coagulation disorders, making them significant in both physiological and pathological contexts (Zhou2013Role; Biswas2016Polymorphisms; Yousef2001The).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the KLKB1 protein, also known as human plasma kallikrein, includes several specific domains that are crucial for its function. The protein features a trypsin-like serine protease domain located at the C-terminus, which is common among serine proteases and essential for the protein's enzymatic activity (Koumandou2013Evolution). Additionally, KLKB1 contains four N-terminal APPLE domains, which are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions, particularly binding to high-molecular-weight kininogen and facilitating dimerization in Factor XI (Koumandou2013Evolution).

The primary structure of KLKB1 consists of 638 amino acids (Koumandou2013Evolution). However, details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available sources. Similarly, information on prominent folds, common post-translational modifications, and splice variant isoforms of KLKB1 is not detailed in the provided excerpts.

Overall, the structural features of KLKB1, such as the serine protease and APPLE domains, highlight its functional roles in blood coagulation, inflammation, and other physiological processes.

## Function
The KLKB1 gene encodes plasma prekallikrein, a precursor to the serine protease plasma kallikrein (KAL), which is involved in several key physiological processes. Plasma kallikrein plays a crucial role in the kallikrein-kinin system, primarily functioning in blood coagulation, inflammation, and blood pressure regulation. It acts by cleaving high-molecular-weight kininogen to release bradykinin, a peptide that mediates vasodilation and increases vascular permeability, essential for maintaining normal blood flow and inflammatory responses (Zhou2013Role; Cheng2022Genetics; Yousef2001The).

In the context of blood pressure regulation, plasma kallikrein contributes to the conversion of inactive circulating prorenin into active renin, a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system. This activation process is pivotal for the subsequent formation of angiotensin I from angiotensinogen, leading to the production of angiotensin II, which is responsible for vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure (Biswas2016Polymorphisms).

Additionally, genetic variants of KLKB1 can affect the levels of active renin in the plasma, suggesting that the functional efficiency of KAL in this conversion process can be influenced by specific polymorphisms within the KLKB1 gene (Biswas2016Polymorphisms). This highlights the gene's significant role in vascular health and its implications in conditions like hypertension and venous thrombosis (Zhou2013Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLKB1 gene, which encodes plasma kallikrein, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting blood coagulation and blood pressure regulation. One significant condition linked to KLKB1 mutations is prekallikrein (PK) deficiency. This deficiency is characterized by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) while maintaining normal activity of other coagulation factors. Severe PK deficiency can lead to various thromboembolic and bleeding events, although the prevalence of bleeding is notably low, suggesting that routine administration of prohemostatic products before surgical procedures may not be necessary for affected individuals (Barco2020Severe).

Additionally, variations in the KLKB1 gene have been studied for their association with essential hypertension. Specific haplotypes containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs2304595 and rs4253325 have been identified as contributing to an increased risk of hypertension. These findings highlight the role of genetic variations in KLKB1 in the regulation of blood pressure, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Lu2007Common).

Overall, alterations in the KLKB1 gene through mutations or variations in gene expression are crucial in understanding and managing related cardiovascular and coagulation disorders.

## Interactions
KLKB1 encodes prekallikrein, which is involved in several key protein interactions crucial for its function in the coagulation and inflammation processes. Prekallikrein (PK) is noncovalently bound to high molecular weight kininogen (HK), which is essential for its activation by factor XIIa (FXIIa). This interaction not only facilitates PK's activation but also allows PK to bind to cells such as endothelial cells, platelets, and neutrophils. The binding sites on PK for HK are located in the A1, A2, and A4 apple domains, with the A2 domain being particularly critical for this complex formation (Visser2020Role). 

Upon activation by FXIIa, PK is converted into its active form, plasma kallikrein (PKa), which then participates in the reciprocal activation of FXII and also directly activates factor XI (FXI) and factor IX (FIX), contributing to downstream thrombin generation (Wan2022Kallikrein). Additionally, PKa has been found to enhance the anticoagulant function of thrombomodulin (TM) and activated protein C (APC) in thrombin generation assays, suggesting interactions between kallikrein and components of the protein C pathway (Wan2022Kallikrein). 

These interactions underline the multifunctional role of KLKB1 in blood coagulation and inflammatory response pathways.
