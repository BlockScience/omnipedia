# MYL3

## Overview
The MYL3 gene encodes the myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) protein, a crucial component of the myosin complex in cardiac muscle cells. MYL3 plays a vital role in muscle contraction and cardiac function by contributing to the structural integrity and regulatory mechanisms of the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle contraction. The protein is particularly important for its involvement in calcium binding and interaction with the myosin heavy chain, which are essential for the contraction dynamics of the heart. Mutations in the MYL3 gene are associated with various cardiomyopathies, highlighting its significance in cardiovascular health (Hernandez2007Myosin; Osborn2021Autosomal). The protein itself, classified as a myosin essential light chain, is integral not only to muscle contraction but also to the regulation of muscle pathology and cellular signaling pathways in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues (Cao2023MYL3).

## Structure
The MYL3 gene encodes the myosin essential light chain 3 (ELCv), a protein integral to the function and structure of cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin. The primary structure of MYL3 consists of 195 amino acids organized into a sequence that includes EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs, although these motifs have largely lost their ability to bind calcium, except in specific cases like scallop myosin ELC (Hernandez2007Myosin; Sitbon2019Insights). The secondary structure features an NH2-terminal actin-binding domain and a proline-rich region, with mutations associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) located in the Î±-helix of the first EF-hand domain and in the exposed loop and Î²-sheet COOH-terminal region of the third EF-hand motif (Hernandez2007Myosin).

The tertiary structure of the ELCv protein, based on the crystal structure of the scallop myosin regulatory domain, reveals the spatial arrangement of these domains and motifs, crucial for its interaction with the myosin heavy chain and actin (Yampolskaya2022Properties). The quaternary structure involves the integration of ELCv into the larger myosin complex, stabilizing the Î±-helical lever arm domain of the myosin head, which is essential for muscle contraction dynamics (Hernandez2007Myosin).

Post-translational modifications identified in MYL3 include phosphorylation of specific residues such as Ser195 and Thr69, which are important for the protein's function during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (Sitbon2019Insights). These modifications likely influence the interaction dynamics within the myosin complex and affect overall muscle contractility.

## Function
The MYL3 gene encodes the myosin light chain 3 (MYL3), a vital component of the myosin protein complex in cardiac muscle cells. This protein is integral to the heart's contractile system, playing a crucial role in muscle contraction by contributing to the structure and function of the sarcomere, the basic contractile unit of striated muscles. MYL3 is specifically involved in the calcium binding within the EF-hand motif, essential for the contraction mechanism of the heart muscle, influencing the force production during heartbeats (Osborn2021Autosomal).

In the cellular context, MYL3 binds to the beta-myosin heavy chain at the IQ motif in the lever arm domain of the myosin head, a critical area for the interaction of myosin with actin, facilitating effective muscle contraction and force production (Hernandez2007Myosin). The protein's function is also crucial for maintaining proper cardiac function and structure, as evidenced by studies using zebrafish models where mutations in MYL3 led to compromised cardiac function (Osborn2021Autosomal).

Overall, the molecular activities of MYL3 are fundamental to the physiological functioning of cardiac muscle fibers, underscoring its importance in cardiovascular health and its implications in various cardiomyopathies when mutated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYL3 gene, which encodes the myosin essential light chain of the sarcomere, are associated with various forms of cardiomyopathy, notably hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). These mutations can lead to severe cardiac conditions, including sudden cardiac death. For instance, the p.V79I mutation in MYL3 is characterized by late onset and low expressivity of HCM, with a penetrance of 40% among carriers (Andersen2012A). Another mutation, p.Glu143Lys, has been identified in patients with both HCM and RCM, indicating its significant role in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Caleshu2011Furthering; Olson2002Myosin).

Research also highlights the impact of homozygous MYL3 mutations, which tend to result in more severe phenotypes. For example, homozygous variants like p.Glu143Lys have been linked to early-onset cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology and significant health complications (Olson2002Myosin). Additionally, recessive MYL3 variants have been associated with variable severity of cardiomyopathy, ranging from infantile to early adulthood-onset, further underscoring the critical role of MYL3 in cardiac function and disease (Osborn2021Autosomal).

These findings emphasize the importance of genetic screening and family counseling in managing cardiomyopathies linked to MYL3 mutations, as understanding the genetic basis can significantly influence treatment and prognosis.

## Interactions
MYL3, or myosin light chain 3, interacts with several proteins to regulate cellular processes, particularly in cardiac and skeletal muscle function. In the context of cardiac muscle, MYL3 is known to interact with the Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC). This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning and regulation of muscle contraction (Sitbon2019Insights). Additionally, MYL3 is involved in interactions that affect muscle pathology, as specific mutations in the MYL3 gene can alter its interaction dynamics, leading to various cardiomyopathies and muscle dysfunctions (Sitbon2019Insights).

In chondrocytes, MYL3 plays a significant role in regulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and Notch signaling pathways, which are critical for chondrocyte homeostasis and the progression of osteoarthritis. MYL3 interacts with myosin VI (MYO6), and this interaction is essential for regulating the internalization of Notch receptors through CME. The loss of MYL3 enhances the interaction between MYO6 and clathrin, leading to increased Notch signaling and chondrocyte senescence (Cao2023MYL3). These interactions highlight the role of MYL3 in cellular signaling pathways that influence both muscle function and disease progression.
