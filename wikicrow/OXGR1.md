# OXGR1

## Overview
OXGR1 is a gene that encodes the oxoglutarate receptor 1 (OXGR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological and metabolic processes. The protein, oxoglutarate receptor 1, is primarily responsive to alpha-ketoglutarate, a key intermediate in the Krebs cycle, and plays a significant role in cellular signaling related to metabolic regulation and stress responses. OXGR1 is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the adrenal gland, brain, and gastrointestinal tract, where it influences processes such as epinephrine release, lipolysis, and intestinal motility. The receptor's structure includes seven transmembrane helices, characteristic of GPCRs, and it interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, impacting cellular functions and health conditions ranging from metabolic disorders to inflammation and cancer (Yuan2020Exerciseâinduced; Xu2023The; Yuan2019Î±-ketoglutaric).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the human OXGR1 protein, encoded by the OXGR1 gene, is characterized by several key features. The protein consists of 337 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 38.3 kDa. It is structured with seven transmembrane helices, a notable characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The N-terminal extracellular domain comprises 34 residues, while the C-terminal cytosolic domain includes 32 residues (Biringer2021A). 

A structural model of OXGR1, based on 35.8% sequence homology with the P2Y purinoceptor, is available and provides insights into its tertiary structure. This model highlights the arrangement of the transmembrane helices and the positioning of key amino acid residues around the orthosteric site, crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation. These residues include C106, R110, H114, Y118, H258, R261, I265, and R288, which are predicted to be integral to the protein's function in interacting with ligands such as itaconate (Zeng2023The).

No additional isoforms or splice variants of OXGR1 have been reported, and no post-translational modifications have been experimentally confirmed, although potential sites are listed in supplementary materials (Biringer2021A).

## Function
OXGR1, encoded by the OXGR1 gene, is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily responds to the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), a key intermediate in the Krebs cycle. This receptor is notably expressed in various human tissues including the adrenal gland medulla, testes, brain, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, with the highest expression observed in the adrenal gland medulla (Yuan2020Exerciseâinduced; Xu2023The; Yuan2019Î±-ketoglutaric).

In the adrenal gland, OXGR1 mediates the release of epinephrine by increasing intracellular calcium levels in adrenal chromaffin cells upon AKG binding. This process is crucial for the body's response to stress and metabolic regulation (Yuan2020Exerciseâinduced). Additionally, OXGR1 influences metabolic processes such as lipolysis and fat thermogenesis, playing a significant role in body weight management and the anti-obesity effects of AKG (Yuan2020Exerciseâinduced; Yuan2019Î±-ketoglutaric).

In the gastrointestinal tract, OXGR1 is involved in regulating intestinal motility and the intestinal microenvironment. Activation of OXGR1 by AKG in gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells leads to the modulation of cellular acid-base balance and affects the contraction and relaxation of these muscles, which is essential for maintaining intestinal health (Xu2023The).

Overall, OXGR1 plays a multifaceted role in cellular signaling, influencing both metabolic and physiological processes critical for maintaining homeostasis across different organ systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OXGR1 gene, which encodes the oxoglutarate receptor 1, have been linked to various diseases and conditions due to their impact on cellular metabolism and signaling. For instance, OXGR1 knockout mice develop spontaneous otitis media with effusion (OME), a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, which can lead to hearing loss. This suggests a critical role for OXGR1 in ear health and potentially in similar human conditions (Kerschner2013A). Additionally, alterations in OXGR1 expression are implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. Mice lacking OXGR1 exhibit increased hypertrophy following pressure overload, indicating a protective role of this receptor against heart muscle thickening, which is a common precursor to heart failure (Omede2016The).

In the context of cancer, OXGR1 has been found to be hypermethylated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines compared to normal liver, suggesting that changes in its methylation status could be involved in the pathology of liver cancer (Lu2009Aberrant). Furthermore, OXGR1 deficiency in mice has shown protective effects against oxidative injury in the cecum and helped in avoiding colitis, indicating its potential role in managing intestinal inflammation and related conditions (Xu2023The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of OXGR1 in various pathological conditions and suggest that targeting this receptor could be a potential therapeutic strategy.

## Interactions
OXGR1, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. Notably, OXGR1 forms a molecular complex with the COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5 (CSN5), also known as CSN5 or JAB1. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the pro-hypertrophic STAT3 signaling pathway in cardiac hypertrophy, as CSN5 interacts with TYK2, a major upstream regulator of STAT3 (Omede2016The).

Additionally, OXGR1 interacts with the immunometabolite itaconate (ITA), which acts as an orthosteric agonist. This interaction stimulates specific intracellular signaling pathways, including increases in cytosolic calcium and ERK activation, without affecting cAMP levels or stress fiber formation. The signaling involves Gq/11 proteins but not Gs, Gi, or G12/13 proteins. ITA-induced activation of OXGR1 also leads to receptor endocytosis mediated by Î²-arrestin (Zeng2023The).

In the context of adrenal gland function, OXGR1 is activated by Î±-ketoglutaric acid (AKG), which stimulates the release of epinephrine from adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. This interaction involves intracellular calcium-dependent signaling pathways, highlighting the receptor's role in metabolic regulation (Yuan2020Exerciseâinduced).
