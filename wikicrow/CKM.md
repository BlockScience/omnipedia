# CKM

## Overview
The CKM gene encodes the muscle-specific isoform of creatine kinase, known as creatine kinase, M-type (CKM). This enzyme is a member of the creatine kinase family, which plays a crucial role in energy metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of creatine and using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to create phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This reaction is vital for energy storage and transfer within cells, particularly in muscle tissues where rapid ATP regeneration is required during physical activity. CKM is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles, where it facilitates efficient energy utilization and sustains high-energy phosphate levels to support muscle contraction and relaxation (DubÃ©2014CKM; Brancaccio2007Creatine). The protein itself is structured as a dimer, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, and its function can be modulated by post-translational modifications such as acetylation (Walker2021Acetylation).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the human CKM (creatine kinase, M-type) protein is detailed across several levels of structural biology. The primary structure of CKM consists of 381 amino acids, featuring 35 lysine residues significant for post-translational modifications such as acetylation (Walker2021Acetylation). The tertiary structure, based on a model from rabbit CKM, reveals critical regions for proper folding and dimer formation, essential for its enzymatic function (Walker2021Acetylation). At the quaternary level, CKM forms a stable dimer, which is crucial for its activity in energy metabolism within muscle cells. Disruption of this dimeric structure, particularly through acetylation of lysine residues, leads to a decrease in enzymatic activity, evidenced by increased monomer formation and decreased dimer formation (Walker2021Acetylation).

Acetylation, particularly in the context of heart failure, has been shown to negatively impact the structural and functional integrity of CKM. This modification disrupts salt bridge formations within the dimer interface, crucial for maintaining the dimeric structure and, consequently, the enzyme's activity (Walker2021Acetylation).

## Function
The CKM gene encodes the muscle-specific isoform of creatine kinase, known as CKM, which plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism, particularly within muscle cells. This enzyme is crucial for the reversible transfer of high-energy phosphate groups from phosphocreatine to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thereby regenerating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy carrier in cells. This process is essential during periods of high energy demand such as muscle contraction (Pfefferle2011Comparative; Brancaccio2007Creatine; Zhao1994Mouse).

CKM is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues where it is strategically located within the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle fiber responsible for contraction. Specifically, CKM binds to the M-line structure of the sarcomere, facilitating efficient ATP regeneration directly at the site of mechanical activity (Brancaccio2007Creatine; Yan2016Creatine). This localization supports sustained muscle performance and endurance by ensuring a continuous supply of ATP during muscle contractions.

Moreover, CKM expression and activity are tightly regulated in response to cellular conditions and energy requirements. This regulation helps maintain energy homeostasis, preventing cellular damage from energy depletion during intense physical activities (DubÃ©2014CKM; Yan2016Creatine). The presence and activity of CKM are thus critical not only for muscle contraction but also for the overall energy management and metabolic stability of muscle cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CKM gene, which encodes muscle-specific creatine kinase, have been linked to various muscle and cardiac disorders due to their critical role in energy metabolism. A notable mutation, D54G, has been identified as causing muscle creatine kinase deficiency, which significantly impacts muscle function by reducing the enzyme's substrate binding affinity, activity, and stability. This mutation also makes the enzyme more susceptible to aggregation under stress, leading to decreased levels of active serum creatine kinase (Feng2007Effects). Additionally, the CKM gene's polymorphisms have been associated with different physiological and pathological conditions. For instance, the rs4884 polymorphism has shown a protective effect against knee osteoarthritis in a Mexican population, suggesting that variations in this gene can influence susceptibility to certain diseases (FernÃ¡ndez-Torres2020Ancestral). Furthermore, other polymorphisms like rs8111989 and rs11559024 have been linked to elevated physical performance in athletes and high serum CK-MM levels in patients with statin-associated myopathy, respectively (FernÃ¡ndez-Torres2020Ancestral). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CKM in both muscle health and disease, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in conditions where muscle function is compromised.

## Interactions
CKM, or creatine kinase, muscle type, is involved in several key protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in energy metabolism within muscle cells. One of the primary interactions of CKM is the formation of stable MM homodimers, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. These dimers rely on salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, particularly involving lysine and arginine residues that interact with acidic residues like aspartic acid and glutamic acid (Walker2021Acetylation). 

In the context of heart failure, the acetylation of lysine residues on CKM disrupts these critical salt bridge formations, leading to the destabilization of the MM homodimers and a consequent decrease in enzymatic activity. This modification is reversible; deacetylation by the enzyme sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) restores the formation of functional dimers and rescues the enzymatic activity of CKM (Walker2021Acetylation).

Additionally, CKM interacts with acetyltransferase PCAF in the acetylation process, which negatively impacts its activity. This interaction highlights a regulatory mechanism where CKM activity is modulated by acetylation and deacetylation processes involving specific enzymes (Walker2021Acetylation). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the energy dynamics in muscle cells, especially under stress conditions such as heart failure.
