# BPIFB4

## Overview
The BPIFB4 gene encodes the protein BPI fold containing family B member 4, which is integral to various biological processes, particularly in vascular and endothelial health. This protein exists in multiple variants, including a longevity-associated variant (LAV) that has been studied for its role in enhancing vascular function through the modulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). BPIFB4 is not only crucial for vascular health but also plays a significant role in the immune response and the regulation of endothelial and stem cell functions, which are vital for maintaining blood flow and vascular integrity. The gene and its protein products are implicated in several cellular mechanisms through interactions with other proteins such as 14-3-3 and Heat Shock Protein 90, which facilitate its function in promoting endothelial health and potentially influencing the progression of cardiovascular diseases (Spinelli2017LAV-BPIFB4; Villa2018A).

## Function
The BPIFB4 gene encodes the BPI fold containing family B member 4 protein, which plays a crucial role in various cellular and molecular processes essential for maintaining vascular and endothelial health. The longevity-associated variant (LAV) of BPIFB4 is particularly significant, enhancing the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is vital for vasodilation and proper vascular function. This process is mediated through increased binding to the 14-3-3 protein and interaction with Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90), facilitating eNOS activation and contributing to cardiovascular protection (Spinelli2017LAV-BPIFB4; Villa2018A).

In addition to its vascular roles, BPIFB4 is involved in the immune response. The protein influences the phenotype of macrophages and is implicated in modulating the immune-inflammatory response in vascular systems, which is crucial for managing endothelial functions and potentially influencing the progression of cardiovascular diseases (Dossena2020New; Puca2019Single).

Furthermore, BPIFB4 supports the homing and function of stem cells and endothelial precursor cells, essential for the repair and regeneration of aged and ischemic vessels. This supports not only vascular health but also contributes to the organismal outcomes of improved blood flow and reduced blood pressure in various models (Villa2018A).

## Clinical Significance
BPIFB4, particularly its longevity-associated variant (LAV-BPIFB4), has been linked to various cardiovascular diseases and conditions related to aging. Research indicates that alterations in the expression of BPIFB4 or mutations in the gene can significantly impact health. For instance, lower expression levels of BPIFB4 are associated with severe coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly in patients with three-vessel CAD, a critical and fatal form of the disease (Cattaneo2023BPIFB4). Additionally, the rare variant (RV-BPIFB4) has been associated with arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for these conditions (Villa2018A).

Gene therapy using LAV-BPIFB4 has shown promise in various cardiovascular conditions by demonstrating anti-atherosclerotic, anti-hypertensive, pro-angiogenic, and neuroprotective activities in cardiovascular animal models (Cattaneo2023BPIFB4). Furthermore, the expression of BPIFB4, particularly its LAV, has been linked to improved aging and reduced risk of age-related cardiovascular diseases, indicating its role in healthy aging and possibly in the prevention of age-related vascular diseases (Villa2018A). Conversely, the RV-BPIFB4 variant impairs nitric oxide signaling, negatively affecting vascular function and blood pressure, which could contribute to cardiovascular diseases (Vecchione2017A).

## Interactions
BPIFB4, specifically its longevity-associated variant (LAV-BPIFB4), interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. Notably, BPIFB4 forms complexes with nucleolin (NCL) and 14-3-3 proteins. The interaction with NCL is essential for the pro-angiogenic action of LAV-BPIFB4 in aged IHF-PCs, as demonstrated by the inhibition of this action when NCL is silenced (Cattaneo2023The). Additionally, LAV-BPIFB4 shows a distinct interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, which is more efficient compared to the wild-type BPIFB4. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing detectable complexes of BPIFB4-14-3-3 when cells are transfected with LAV-BPIFB4 (Villa2015Genetic).

BPIFB4 also interacts with protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), enhancing the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha and reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress (Villa2015Genetic). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of BPIFB4 by PERK at serine 75 is crucial for its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and the subsequent recruitment of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is necessary for activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (Villa2015Genetic; Villa2018A). These interactions underline the role of BPIFB4 in modulating endothelial function and vascular health.
