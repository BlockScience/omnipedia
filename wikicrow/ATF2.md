# ATF2

## Overview
ATF2, or Activating Transcription Factor 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. The ATF2 protein plays a critical role in cellular processes such as growth, survival, and apoptosis by binding to specific DNA elements in the promoters of target genes. Structurally, ATF2 contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain essential for DNA binding and dimerization, allowing it to form complexes with itself or other proteins to regulate transcription (Lau2012ATF2). Functionally, ATF2 is activated by phosphorylation, primarily in response to stress signals, which enhances its transcriptional activity and its role in DNA damage response (Watson2017ATF2). The protein's involvement in multiple signaling pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stresses.

## Structure
The ATF2 protein, encoded by the ATF2 gene, is a multifaceted transcription factor characterized by distinct structural domains that facilitate its function in gene regulation. The protein consists of an N-terminal transactivation domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The transactivation domain includes a zinc finger-like subdomain with a structured arrangement of an antiparallel beta-sheet and an alpha-helix, stabilized by a zinc atom coordinated by cysteine and histidine residues (Nagadoi1999Solution). This domain is crucial for the protein's interaction with other molecular components.

The C-terminal region of ATF2 features a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) motif, essential for DNA binding and dimerization. This domain allows ATF2 to form either homodimers or heterodimers, which are necessary for its binding to the cAMP response element (CRE) in DNA and subsequent transcriptional activation (Panne2004Crystal; Lau2012ATF2).

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in regulating ATF2's activity. Phosphorylation at multiple sites, including threonine and serine residues, is critical for activating the protein in response to various stimuli. These modifications can alter ATF2's conformation and its ability to interact with other proteins and DNA (Watson2017ATF2).

Additionally, ATF2 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their domain compositions and hence in their functional capabilities. These isoforms can lack certain regulatory elements, affecting their transcriptional activity and cellular localization (Lau2012ATF2).

## Function
ATF2, a transcription factor encoded by the ATF2 gene, is integral to various molecular processes in healthy human cells. It binds directly to DNA promoter elements to regulate the transcription of specific target genes, a function facilitated by its bZIP domain, which is conserved across various splice isoforms (Lau2012ATF2). ATF2 is also involved in chromatin restructuring and the DNA damage response, interacting with chromatin-modifying proteins to influence global heterochromatin organization (Lau2012ATF2). 

In response to DNA damage, ATF2 is phosphorylated by ATM at specific serine residues, promoting its colocalization with components of the MRN complex in ionizing radiation-induced foci, aiding in DNA repair. This phosphorylation contributes to the intra-S phase checkpoint, ensuring proper repair of damaged DNA (Lau2012ATF2). Additionally, ATF2 interacts with the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 in a feedback loop mechanism that enhances ATM activities, crucial for the cellular response to genotoxic stress (Lau2012ATF2).

ATF2's role extends to influencing cell biology and organismal outcomes by regulating gene expression in response to environmental and cellular changes, impacting processes such as cell cycle progression, cell survival, and apoptosis (Ouwens2002Growth).

## Clinical Significance
ATF2 (Activating Transcription Factor 2) is implicated in various diseases and conditions primarily through mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In cancer biology, ATF2 exhibits dual roles, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the cellular context. For instance, reduced levels of ATF2 predispose mice to mammary tumors and are also observed in human breast cancers, suggesting a tumor suppressor role in this context (Maekawa2007Reduced). Conversely, ATF2 mutations are associated with increased tumor susceptibility and progression in models of skin cancer, where its altered expression or localization correlates with the development of squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma (Bhoumik2008Suppressor; Li2010Radiation).

In addition to cancer, ATF2 is involved in inflammatory diseases. It is highly expressed in macrophages within white adipose tissues in obesity and plays a significant role in inflammatory responses by influencing the expression of proinflammatory genes, cytokines, and chemokines (Yu2014The). The gene's role in inflammation is further highlighted by its involvement in systemic sclerosis, where it serves as a marker for lung involvement and inflammation (Yu2014The).

Overall, the clinical significance of ATF2 spans a spectrum of pathological conditions, underlining its importance in both oncogenic and inflammatory pathways.

## Interactions
ATF2 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation. One of the key interactions is with the coactivator ASC-2, which enhances ATF2's interaction with another transcription factor, C/EBPÎ±. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of granulopoietic genes and is further enhanced by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and phosphorylation by p38Î² kinase (Hong2004Activation). ATF2 also forms heterodimers with c-Jun, which are essential for binding to the cAMP response element (CRE) in DNA, a process that is crucial for regulating various gene transcriptions (Hsu2012Critical).

Additionally, ATF2 and C/EBPÎ± can form a heterodimeric DNA binding complex that does not bind to CRE sites but to an asymmetric sequence composed of one consensus half-site for each monomer, suggesting a unique regulatory function for this heterodimer (Shuman1997ATF-2). The interaction between ATF2 and the hepatitis B virus X protein (pX) alters the DNA binding specificity of ATF2, enabling it to bind to sequences it normally would not, which plays a role in transcriptional regulation during viral infection (Maguire1991HBV). These interactions highlight ATF2's versatile role in transcriptional regulation through complex interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids.
