# ORC2

## Overview
ORC2, or Origin Recognition Complex Subunit 2, is a gene in humans that encodes a protein essential for the initiation of DNA replication. This protein is a component of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is critical for the identification and binding of replication origins within the DNA during the cell cycle. ORC2 does not possess enzymatic activity but plays a structural and regulatory role within the ORC, facilitating the assembly and proper function of the pre-replicative complex. This complex is necessary for the replication of DNA and the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 to the S phase. The ORC2 protein interacts with other subunits of the ORC, contributing to its stability and function in DNA replication initiation (Radichev2006Genetic). Additionally, ORC2 is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization and maintaining genomic stability, which are vital for normal cell proliferation and prevention of disease states such as cancer (Radichev2006Genetic).

## Structure
The human ORC2 protein, a subunit of the origin recognition complex, exhibits a complex molecular structure crucial for its role in DNA replication initiation. ORC2 contains a RecA-like subdomain but lacks ATPase activities, which are present in other subunits such as ORC1, ORC4, and ORC5 (Cheng2020Structural). The protein is characterized by a winged-helix domain (WHD), which is instrumental in DNA binding. This WHD undergoes significant conformational changes, rotating approximately 120 degrees to block the central DNA-binding channel in an autoinhibited state, a deviation from other ORC structures like those from Drosophila (Cheng2020Structural).

In terms of secondary structure, ORC2-WHD includes key elements such as the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, which interacts closely with the AAA+ domains of ORC4 and ORC5 to regulate the DNA-binding ability of the complex (Cheng2020Structural). The tertiary structure of ORC2 involves the arrangement of these domains and motifs to facilitate complex assembly and regulatory functions.

At the quaternary level, ORC2 interacts with other ORC subunits to form a dynamic complex, essential for the recruitment of the complex to replication origins. This interaction is particularly evident in the HsORC2-5 and HsORC1-5 complexes, where structural rearrangements play a critical role in transitioning from an inactive to an active state (Cheng2020Structural).

Overall, the structural features of ORC2, including its specific domains and their interactions, underscore its pivotal role in the control and initiation of DNA replication.

## Function
ORC2, a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC), is pivotal in the initiation of DNA replication in human cells. It plays a critical role in recognizing replication origins on the DNA and is essential for the assembly of the pre-replicative complex, which is necessary for DNA replication to commence. ORC2 interacts specifically with other ORC subunits, such as Orc3 and Orc5, to form a stable ORC complex, which is crucial for the proper assembly and nuclear localization of the ORC (Radichev2006Genetic). This protein also contains specific domains, including nuclear localization signals (NLS-A, NLS-B), which are vital for its transport into the nucleus, ensuring that ORC assembly occurs within this organelle to enable the initiation of DNA replication (Radichev2006Genetic).

Furthermore, ORC2 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Its depletion leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, preventing progression to the S phase where DNA synthesis occurs. This arrest is linked to the inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2, a critical regulator of the cell cycle (Machida2005Acute). ORC2's role extends to maintaining genomic stability, as evidenced by its involvement in chromosome structure regulation and centrosome copy number (Radichev2006Genetic). Additionally, ORC2 has been shown to bind tightly to chromatin in some cell lines, indicating its role in chromatin association, which varies among different cell lines (Radichev2006Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ORC2 gene, which encodes a subunit of the origin recognition complex crucial for DNA replication initiation, have significant clinical implications. Specific mutations within the ORC2 gene can lead to mislocalization of the Orc2 protein to the cytoplasm, disrupting its ability to effectively replace endogenous Orc2 and assemble the origin recognition complex. This mislocalization affects normal cell proliferation and can contribute to genomic instability, a hallmark of various cancers and other diseases (Radichev2006Genetic). Additionally, the genetic analysis of ORC2 has revealed that alterations in specific domains essential for the assembly and nuclear localization of the origin recognition complex can prevent the proper functioning of this critical protein complex. Such disruptions can potentially lead to abnormal cell cycle progression and tumor development, highlighting the importance of ORC2 in maintaining genomic stability (Radichev2006Genetic).

While the direct involvement of ORC2 mutations in specific syndromes or diseases has not been explicitly detailed in the provided contexts, the role of ORC2 in essential cellular processes underscores its potential impact on cellular dysfunction and disease when mutated or dysregulated.

## Interactions
ORC2, a subunit of the origin recognition complex, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA replication initiation. It forms a stable subcomplex with ORC3, ORC4, and ORC5 within the larger ORC structure, which is essential for binding to replication origins in DNA (Lee2012Phosphorylation). ORC2's interaction with the E2 protein of papillomaviruses, specifically BPV-1 and HPV-31, is facilitated by the N-terminal trans-activation domain of E2, although this interaction does not lead to ORC2's presence at the viral origin of replication (DeSmet2016The).

Phosphorylation of ORC2 at specific sites (Thr-116 and Thr-226) influences its association with chromatin, leading to the dissociation of the ORC from chromatin and replication origins, thereby modulating the initiation of DNA replication (Lee2012Phosphorylation). Additionally, ORC2 interacts with TRF2 (telomere repeat factor 2), forming a stable complex that is crucial for telomere maintenance and replication (Atanasiu2006ORC).

In the context of viral infections, ORC2 plays a role in suppressing papillomavirus genome replication during the maintenance phase by interfering with the loading of the E2 protein at the viral origin (DeSmet2016The). This interaction changes during the viral amplification stage, where high levels of E2 inhibit ORC2 function, thus favoring viral replication over host cell origin licensing.
