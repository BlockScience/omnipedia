# PTGER4

## Overview
PTGER4 is a gene that encodes the prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP4), a protein that belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor subtype is specifically involved in binding prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key mediator in various physiological processes including inflammation, gastrointestinal integrity, and immune system function. The protein structure of PTGER4 features seven transmembrane domains, typical of GPCRs, which facilitate its role in cellular signaling across the cell membrane. PTGER4 is significant in medical research due to its implications in various diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and gastric cancer, where its expression and genetic variations can influence disease outcomes and susceptibility (Wu2020Association; Heinrichs2018Evidence; Rodriguez-Rodriguez2015PTGER4).

## Structure
PTGER4, or Prostaglandin E Receptor 4, encodes a protein that is part of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically within the EP receptor subfamily which binds prostaglandins. The protein structure of PTGER4 includes seven transmembrane domains, which is characteristic of GPCRs. These domains are crucial for the protein's function in signal transduction across the cell membrane. PTGER4 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are common in GPCRs and influence the receptor's activity and its interaction with cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of PTGER4 may exist, potentially leading to variations in the receptor's structure and function, affecting its physiological roles and implications in diseases such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

The specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of PTGER4, including prominent folds or specific domains beyond the general GPCR characteristics, are not provided in the available excerpts. Therefore, a detailed description of these aspects cannot be given without further information.

## Function
PTGER4 encodes the EP4 subtype of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family. This receptor plays a critical role in various cellular and physiological processes by mediating the effects of PGE2. In the gastrointestinal tract, PTGER4 is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. It supports the intestinal stem cell niche and the epithelial barrier, which are essential for the gut's protective functions and its ability to regenerate after injury. Activation of PTGER4 on intestinal macrophages leads to the secretion of chemokines like CXCL1, which promotes epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation, aiding in mucosal healing during conditions such as colitis (Na2021Prostaglandin).

In the immune system, PTGER4 influences B cell function by acting as a negative regulator of B cell receptor signaling. This modulation is important for controlling B cell proliferation and viability, and PTGER4 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor in B cell lymphomas. Its expression is inversely correlated with genes that promote the growth and survival of B cell lymphoma, highlighting its role in tumor suppression (Murn2008Prostaglandin).

Overall, PTGER4 is integral to both maintaining gastrointestinal integrity and modulating immune responses, underscoring its importance in human health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
PTGER4, encoding the prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4, has been implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. Notably, PTGER4 polymorphisms are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), with specific polymorphisms significantly influencing disease risk in Caucasian populations (Wu2020Association). The gene's variants, such as rs4613763 and rs17234657, have been linked to increased susceptibility to these conditions. Additionally, PTGER4 has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, where certain gene variants correlate with the progression of radiological joint damage (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2015PTGER4).

In the context of gastric cancer, genetic variability at the PTGER4 locus, particularly when interacting with environmental factors like H. pylori infection, contributes to the disease's pathogenesis (Heinrichs2018Evidence). The gene's role is further highlighted by its involvement in the COX-2/PGE2 pathway, crucial in creating inflammatory microenvironments in gastric cancer.

Moreover, PTGER4's interaction with other genes and its expression influenced by regulatory elements also underscore its significance in disease mechanisms. For instance, its interaction with the ATG16L1 gene in Crohn's disease suggests a complex genetic interplay affecting disease susceptibility and progression (Glas2012PTGER4).

## Interactions
PTGER4, encoding the prostaglandin E receptor 4, is involved in several key protein-protein interactions that modulate inflammatory responses and macrophage activation. One of the primary interactions is with EPRAP (EP4-associated protein), which plays a crucial role in the anti-inflammatory functions mediated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This interaction inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation of NF-ÎºB1 p105, a process essential for the activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway, a central factor in inflammatory responses. Specifically, EPRAP interacts directly with the N terminus of the p50 subunit and the C terminus of p105, part of the NF-ÎºB1 protein complex, thereby attenuating the activation of NF-ÎºB and subsequent inflammatory responses (Minami2008Prostaglandin).

Additionally, EP4 forms a complex with EPRAP and NF-ÎºB1, which includes the p105 and p50 subunits. This complex formation is significant for the protective action of EPRAP against p105 phosphorylation, enhanced by PGE2-EP4 signaling (Minami2008Prostaglandin). The interaction does not involve direct binding between EPRAP and the p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB, highlighting a specific regulatory mechanism through selective subunit interaction (Minami2008Prostaglandin).

These interactions underscore the role of PTGER4 in modulating key inflammatory pathways through its association with other proteins, impacting cellular responses in macrophages and potentially other cell types involved in inflammation.
