# CASP8

## Overview
CASP8 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein caspase-8, a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. Caspase-8 plays a crucial role in apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death, primarily through the extrinsic pathway which is triggered by external signals. This protein is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme that is activated through cleavage by other proteins. Activation of caspase-8 initiates a cascade of further caspase activations, leading to apoptosis. Caspase-8 is also involved in non-apoptotic processes, including cell differentiation and necroptosis, indicating its multifunctional roles in cellular homeostasis and immune response (Orning2020Multiple). The gene and its protein product are significant not only for their roles in cell death but also in various clinical contexts such as cancer, immune disorders, and inflammatory diseases, where alterations in CASP8 function can have profound implications (Lehle2019Intestinal; Soung2005CASPASE-8).

## Structure
CASP8, or caspase-8, is a protein encoded by the CASP8 gene, which plays a pivotal role in apoptosis. The protein structure of caspase-8 is complex, consisting of several key domains and structural features that are crucial for its function.

The primary structure of caspase-8 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its apoptotic function. Notably, caspase-8 contains two death effector domains (DEDs) at its N-terminal, which are critical for mediating interactions with other proteins in the apoptosis pathway (Shen2015Crystal; Shen2018Structural).

The secondary structure of caspase-8 is characterized by alpha-helices and beta-sheets. These elements are crucial for the overall folding and functionality of the protein (Sakamaki2014The).

In terms of tertiary structure, caspase-8 is formed from the proteolytic processing of procaspase-8 into one p18 and one p12 subunit, each consisting of six Î² strands and five Î± helices, forming a twisted Î²-sheet structure (Blanchard1999The).

The quaternary structure of caspase-8 involves the dimerization of two p18-p12 units, which is essential for its catalytic activity. This dimer has dimensions approximately 50 Ã 60 Ã 30 Ã3 (Blanchard1999The). The protein also forms a heterotetramer consisting of two large and two small subunits in its active form (Shen2015Crystal).

Caspase-8 undergoes several post-translational modifications, which can influence its activity and interactions. These modifications include phosphorylation at multiple sites, which modulate its apoptotic functions (Tummers2017Caspaseâ8:).

Overall, the structure of caspase-8 is integral to its role in initiating apoptosis, with each domain and structural feature playing a specific role in this critical cellular process.

## Function
Caspase-8, encoded by the CASP8 gene, is a cysteine protease that plays a central role in apoptosis, particularly through the extrinsic apoptosis pathway initiated by external signals. This pathway involves ligand binding to death receptors like TNF receptor, TRAIL receptors, and FAS receptor, leading to the recruitment and activation of caspase-8 through adaptor proteins such as FAS-associated death domain (FADD). Once activated, caspase-8 can cleave and activate executioner caspases like caspase-3 and -7, which execute the apoptosis process characterized by DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and cell shrinkage (Orning2020Multiple).

Beyond its role in apoptosis, caspase-8 is involved in various non-apoptotic functions that are crucial for immune responses and cellular homeostasis. It participates in NF-ÎºB signaling, essential for inflammatory responses and immune cell activation. Caspase-8 is also implicated in the activation of the inflammasome, contributing to inflammation and innate immunity by regulating the release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1Î² (Orning2020Multiple).

These multifunctional roles of caspase-8 underscore its importance not only in programmed cell death but also in maintaining cellular and immune system balance, highlighting its complex involvement in various cellular signaling pathways that contribute to health and disease (Orning2020Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CASP8 gene, which encodes caspase-8, have been linked to a variety of diseases, primarily characterized by altered apoptosis and immune dysfunctions. Notably, CASP8 mutations are associated with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD), conditions marked by severe gastrointestinal symptoms and increased susceptibility to infections. These mutations, such as c.710A>G and c.793C>T, result in impaired protein expression and lead to significant immune dysfunctions including altered T-cell distribution and impaired B-cell maturation (Lehle2019Intestinal).

In cancer, CASP8 plays a dual role, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while its inactivation is linked to increased cancer risk in others. For instance, CASP8 deficiency due to mutations like those observed in gastric cancers can impair apoptosis, allowing abnormal cells to survive and proliferate, potentially contributing to cancer progression (Soung2005CASPASE-8). Furthermore, specific polymorphisms in CASP8 have been associated with reduced susceptibility to various cancers, including lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers in different populations (TANG2015Caspase-8; MacPherson2004Association). Conversely, the loss of CASP8 expression, often due to methylation of the promoter region, is frequently observed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), highlighting its role in the differential pathogenesis of lung cancers (Shivapurkar2002Differential).

## Interactions
CASP8 (caspase 8) interacts with various proteins to regulate apoptosis and other cell death pathways. It forms a complex with the p35 protein from baculoviruses, where p35 inhibits CASP8 through a covalent thioester linkage and by blocking the active site, preventing caspase activity essential for apoptosis (Xu2001Covalent). Additionally, CASP8 is involved in the apoptotic pathway related to Huntington's disease through interactions with huntingtin-interacting proteins Hip-1 and Hippi. The prodomain of CASP8 is crucial for its interaction with Hippi, and this interaction is necessary for the recruitment and activation of CASP8, which then participates in caspase-8-dependent apoptotic pathways (Gervais2002Recruitment).

CASP8 also interacts with the ASC protein, which contains a pyrin domain (PD) and a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PD of ASC physically interacts with CASP8, playing a role in apoptosis and NF-ÎºB activation pathways (Masumoto2003ASC). Furthermore, CASP8 interacts with receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), where it cleaves RIPK1 to prevent excessive cell death and inflammation, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Schwarzer2020New). These interactions underscore the multifaceted roles of CASP8 in regulating cell death and inflammation across different cellular contexts.
