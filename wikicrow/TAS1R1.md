# TAS1R1

## Overview
TAS1R1 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 1 receptor member 1, a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the perception of umami taste. This receptor is part of a heterodimeric complex with TAS1R3, which is essential for detecting amino acids and small peptides like glutamate, commonly found in protein-rich foods. The protein encoded by TAS1R1 is characterized by a large extracellular Venus Flytrap Module (VFTM) for ligand binding, a transmembrane domain, and a cysteine-rich domain, typical features of GPCRs that facilitate signal transduction upon ligand binding. Beyond its primary role in taste perception, TAS1R1 is also implicated in various physiological functions including metabolic sensing and immune responses in non-gustatory tissues (Carey2022Impact; Rawal2013Do).

## Structure
TAS1R1, a component of the umami taste receptor complex, is a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that forms heterodimers with TAS1R3 to function effectively in taste perception. The protein structure of TAS1R1 includes a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) known as the Venus Flytrap Module (VFTM), which is crucial for ligand binding. This domain is shared with TAS1R3, and together they play a significant role in the receptor's ability to bind umami tastants such as glutamate (Pallante2021On).

The receptor also features a Transmembrane Domain (TMD) and a Cysteine-Rich Domain (CRD), which are typical of GPCRs. These domains contribute to the receptor's structural integrity and function in signal transduction. The VFTM undergoes a two-stage conformational change upon ligand binding, which is essential for activating the receptor (Pallante2021On).

While the primary sequence and the presence of specific domains such as the VFTM, TMD, and CRD are noted, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TAS1R1 is not available in the provided excerpts. Similarly, information on prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of TAS1R1 is not detailed in the sources provided.

## Function
TAS1R1, in conjunction with TAS1R3, forms a heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptor that is primarily responsible for the perception of umami taste in humans. This receptor complex detects the presence of glutamate, which is a key component of the umami flavor associated with amino acids and proteins in foods (Rawal2013Do; Valente2018Genes). The TAS1R1 gene is expressed in taste receptor cells located in various parts of the tongue, including fungiform and circumvallate papillae, which are critical for the transduction of taste signals (Rawal2013Do).

Beyond the primary role in taste perception, TAS1R1 is also expressed in non-gustatory tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, airway epithelia, and thyroid, suggesting roles in metabolic sensing and immune responses. For instance, in the airway, TAS1R1 helps sense changes in glucose concentration, which is important for modulating responses to bacterial infections (Carey2022Impact). This broader expression pattern indicates that TAS1R1 may have additional physiological functions beyond taste perception, potentially involving cellular signaling and monitoring of the chemical environment in various tissues (Carey2022Impact).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TAS1R1 gene have been linked to various health conditions, particularly in the context of cancer. Studies have shown that individuals with specific polymorphisms in the TAS1R1 gene, such as the rs34160967 heterozygote, exhibit an increased risk of gastric cancer, especially in males (Choi2016Variations). Furthermore, the expression levels of TAS1R1 in different types of solid tumors have been associated with survival outcomes. Increased expression of TAS1R1 has been correlated with improved survival rates in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting a potential protective role of this gene in certain cancer subtypes (Carey2022Impact).

Additionally, TAS1R1 gene variants influence dietary behaviors and lifestyle choices, such as tobacco consumption, which can modify the risk of developing gastric cancer. For instance, males with the TAS1R1 rs11587438 CC genotype tend to consume fewer cigarettes, which is associated with a lower risk of gastric cancer (Choi2016Variations). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TAS1R1 not only in the prognosis and potential treatment of cancer but also in the prevention strategies through lifestyle modifications influenced by genetic predispositions.

## Interactions
TAS1R1, in conjunction with TAS1R3, forms a heterodimeric amino acid taste receptor that is crucial for the perception of umami taste from amino acids. This receptor complex is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which initiates signal transduction cascades upon ligand binding, typically interacting with specific G proteins. In bovine mammary epithelial cells, the TAS1R1/TAS1R3 complex is involved in sensing extracellular amino acids and activating the mTOR signaling pathway, a critical pathway for protein synthesis and cellular growth. This activation is mediated through the elevation of intracellular calcium levels, which subsequently leads to the phosphorylation of several key proteins in the mTOR pathway, such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase Î²-1 and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (Zhou2018Methionine). The knockdown of TAS1R1 using siRNA has shown decreased intracellular calcium levels and reduced phosphorylation of these mTOR pathway components, further underscoring the receptor's role in this signaling cascade (Zhou2018Methionine). Additionally, the interaction of TAS1R1 with these signaling pathways suggests its involvement in broader regulatory mechanisms, potentially affecting gene expression related to milk protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells (Zhou2018Methionine).
