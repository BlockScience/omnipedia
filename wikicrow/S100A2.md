# S100A2

## Overview
S100A2, a gene located on chromosome 1q21, encodes the protein S100 calcium binding protein A2, which is a member of the S100 family of proteins known for their role in calcium-binding and regulation of a variety of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. The S100A2 protein functions primarily as a calcium sensor and signal transducer, exhibiting a high affinity for calcium ions, which facilitates its role in modulating various protein interactions and cellular functions. It is predominantly expressed in tissues like skin and lung, and its expression levels are often altered in various cancer types, making it a potential biomarker for disease progression and prognosis. The protein's ability to interact with other molecules, particularly tumor suppressor proteins, underscores its significance in cellular regulatory mechanisms and its potential impact on cancer biology (Mueller2005The; Wolf2010S100A2).

## Structure
S100A2, a member of the S100 protein family, is characterized by its unique structural features that facilitate its function as a calcium-binding protein. The primary structure of S100A2 consists of 97 amino acid residues and includes two EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures involved in calcium ion coordination. The N-terminal EF-hand is specific to the S100 family and comprises 14 residues, while the C-terminal EF-hand follows the classical EF-hand motif with 12 residues (Koch2012The).

The secondary structure of S100A2 is rich in Î±-helices, typical of the S100 protein family. Upon calcium binding, there is a significant reorientation of helix III, approximately 92Â°, which is crucial for the protein's function (Koch2012The). This reorientation facilitates the exposure of a hydrophobic cavity that serves as a binding site for target proteins like p53 (Koch2012The).

In terms of quaternary structure, S100A2 primarily forms homodimers but can also form higher oligomers such as tetramers to octamers under certain conditions (Koch2012The). The dimerization and oligomerization are significant for its extracellular cytokine-like function and are influenced by the presence of calcium ions.

S100A2 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, with the gene encoding multiple variants that share identical protein sequences but differ in exon structure (Wolf2010S100A2). This variability may influence the protein's functional dynamics and interaction with other cellular components.

## Function
S100A2, a member of the S100 protein family, is primarily localized in the nucleus of cells but can translocate to the cytoplasm in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels. This translocation may involve disulfide-linked dimer formation, which is indicative of its role in calcium signaling and regulation within the cell (Wolf2010S100A2). The protein is involved in the transcriptional activation by members of the p53 family, such as p63 and p73, suggesting its significant role in cellular differentiation processes (Wolf2010S100A2).

In healthy cells, S100A2 interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, enhancing p53's transcriptional activity in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the cytoskeleton and potentially in tumor suppression, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular integrity (Wolf2010S100A2). The protein also binds both calcium and zinc ions, which induce conformational changes affecting its stability and interaction with other molecules, such as nuclear targets. This binding is essential for its regulatory role in ion homeostasis within cells (Wolf2010S100A2).

Furthermore, S100A2's expression is regulated by the cell cycle and can be induced by the activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in human keratinocytes, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation and response to growth factors (Wolf2010S100A2). These molecular activities and interactions underscore S100A2's critical functions in cell biology, particularly in processes related to cell growth, differentiation, and response to cellular stress.

## Clinical Significance
S100A2, a gene implicated in various cancers, exhibits altered expression patterns that correlate with disease progression and patient outcomes. In melanoma, high S100A2 expression in primary tumors contrasts with its low expression in metastatic cells, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Sugino2022Influence). Conversely, in prostate cancer, lower expression levels of S100A2 are associated with favorable outcomes, while benign conditions like prostate hypertrophy show increased expression, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Sugino2022Influence; Wolf2010S100A2). In gastric cancer, downregulation of S100A2 correlates with poor differentiation and worse patient outcomes, further supporting its role in tumor suppression (Sugino2022Influence; Liu2013Clinical).

The gene's expression also varies in squamous cell carcinoma, where it generally acts as a tumor suppressor. Higher expression levels are linked to better prognosis in laryngeal and esophageal types (Sugino2022Influence). However, in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the role of S100A2 is contradictory; some studies show reduced expression correlating with cancer progression, while others find overexpression linked to enhanced migratory behavior and poorer survival outcomes (Wang2017Expression; Wolf2010S100A2).

These findings highlight the complex role of S100A2 in cancer biology, where its expression can significantly influence the progression and prognosis of various cancers.

## Interactions
S100A2, a calcium-binding protein, interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its DNA binding and transcriptional activity in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction specifically involves the C-terminal domain of p53, including the tetramerization domain, which is crucial for the modulation of p53's function in cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell cycle regulation (Mueller2005The). Additionally, S100A2 interacts with erythropoietin (EPO) when in a Ca2+-loaded state, binding through specific residues that contribute to the structural integrity and function of the EPO-S100A2 complex (Kazakov2022Erythropoietin).

S100A2 also binds to FKBP38, inhibiting its association with Bcl-2 and Hsp90, which affects Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanisms in signaling pathways (Hountis2014S100A2). Furthermore, it interacts with the TPR domain of the U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, modulating ubiquitination and degradation processes within the cell (Hountis2014S100A2). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of S100A2 in regulating various cellular functions and signaling pathways, impacting cell growth, transcription, and apoptosis.
