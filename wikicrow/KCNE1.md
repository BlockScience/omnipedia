# KCNE1

## Overview
The KCNE1 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in modulating the activity of the KCNQ1 potassium channel. This protein is essential for the proper function of cardiac and auditory systems, influencing heart rhythm and hearing capabilities. Structurally, KCNE1 features a single transmembrane domain surrounded by intra- and extracellular domains, which facilitate its interaction with the KCNQ1 channel to regulate the kinetics and conductance of the channel. Mutations in the KCNE1 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, including long QT syndrome and familial atrial fibrillation, highlighting its importance in cardiovascular and auditory health (LUNDQUIST2005Expression; Abbott2016KCNE1).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the KCNE1 protein, encoded by the KCNE1 gene, is characterized by a single-span transmembrane domain (TMD) that is crucial for its function as a modulator of the KCNQ1 potassium channel. The TMD of KCNE1 is a curved alpha-helix, spanning residues 45 through 71, which is essential for the physical association with KCNQ1 and influences the channel's gating kinetics and conductance (Kang2008Structure; Sahu2014Structural). This domain is flanked by intra- and extracellular domains comprised of alpha-helices connected by flexible linkers, contributing to the overall roughly spherical shape of the protein (Kang2008Structure).

The extramembrane segments of KCNE1 are arranged in a topologically quasi-mirror fashion around the TMD, with the N- and C-terminal domains consisting of flexibly-linked alpha helices (Van2011Working). The distal C-terminus, comprising residues 107-129, is noted to be disordered and involved in protein-protein interactions, which may include interactions with non-channel proteins within cells (Kang2008Structure).

Structural studies have not detailed post-translational modifications, splice variant isoforms, or specific protein folds beyond the alpha-helical content described. The structural information primarily focuses on the arrangement and conformation of the helices, particularly within the context of its interaction with the KCNQ1 channel, and does not extensively cover tertiary or quaternary structures.

## Function
The KCNE1 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the proper functioning of cardiac and auditory systems in humans. In the heart, KCNE1 forms a complex with the KCNQ1 potassium channel, generating the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) essential for the repolarization phase of the cardiac cycle. This interaction helps maintain the heart's rhythm and prevents arrhythmias, particularly under conditions of physical exertion or stress (LUNDQUIST2005Expression; Abbott2016KCNE1). Mutations in KCNE1 have been linked to congenital long QT syndrome, a disorder that disrupts the heart's electrical system and can lead to irregular heartbeats (LUNDQUIST2005Expression).

In addition to its cardiac roles, KCNE1, in conjunction with KCNQ1, is involved in potassium recycling in the inner ear, a process critical for maintaining the endolymph and normal hearing function. Disruption in this function can lead to sensorineural deafness (Abbott2016KCNE1). The protein is primarily located in the cell membrane, where it interacts with other channel proteins to modulate their function, influencing both cardiac muscle contraction and auditory processes. This modulation includes altering the activation, deactivation, and conductance of the KCNQ1 channels, which are vital for cellular electrical stability and responsiveness (Abbott2016KCNE1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNE1 gene are associated with several cardiac and auditory conditions, notably impacting heart rhythm and hearing capabilities. The gene's mutations are linked to Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome (JLNS) and Romano-Ward Syndrome (RWS), both of which involve prolonged QT intervals on electrocardiograms, a marker for potential arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. JLNS, an autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by profound congenital deafness alongside cardiac arrhythmias, while RWS, an autosomal dominant condition, typically presents with cardiac symptoms without affecting hearing (Faridi2018Mutational).

Additionally, specific mutations in KCNE1, such as the D85N polymorphism, have been identified as risk factors for drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias like torsades de pointes (Nishio2009D85N). The gene is also implicated in familial atrial fibrillation (AF), particularly early-onset forms, through mutations that cause a gain-of-function effect in the I_Ks current, potentially leading to shortened cardiac action potentials and promoting atrial fibrillation (Olesen2012Mutations).

These findings underscore the importance of genetic screening in individuals and families at risk for these conditions, as variations in KCNE1 can significantly influence cardiac and auditory health outcomes.

## Interactions
KCNE1, a regulatory subunit, interacts with the KCNQ1 potassium channel to modulate its function, crucial for cardiac repolarization and hearing. The transmembrane domain (TMD) of KCNE1, characterized as a curved Î±-helix, plays a pivotal role in these interactions. It binds to the S4-S5 linker and the S5-P-S6 pore domain of KCNQ1, influencing the channel's gating properties by stabilizing the open state and increasing conductance (Kang2008Structure). This interaction is essential for the function of the cardiac delayed rectifier current I Ks. 

In different states of the channel, the interaction between KCNE1 and KCNQ1 varies. In the closed state, the intracellular end of the KCNE1 TMD presses on the S4-S5 linker, helping to keep the channel gate closed. Upon membrane depolarization, this interaction is disrupted, allowing the channel to open (Kang2008Structure). Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that KCNE1 induces significant displacements in the KCNQ1 backbone, suggesting allosteric modulation of channel function (Xu2013Building).

Furthermore, KCNE1 affects the structural dynamics of KCNQ1 by stabilizing the S5-P linker and interacting with critical areas like the pore loop and the S6 hinge, which are essential for pore conductance and the probability of the activation gate opening (Xu2013Building). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory role of KCNE1 in cardiac and auditory functions.
