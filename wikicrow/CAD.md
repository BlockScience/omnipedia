# CAD

## Overview
The CAD gene, located in humans, is responsible for encoding a crucial multifunctional protein involved in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, essential components of DNA and RNA. This protein, not to be confused with the gene itself, integrates the enzymatic activities of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 (CPS2), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), and dihydroorotase (DHOase). These enzymes sequentially catalyze the initial steps in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, which are vital for cellular functions such as DNA replication and repair. The protein encoded by CAD is predominantly cytoplasmic and plays a pivotal role in maintaining nucleotide pool balance within the cell, which is critical for cell growth and viability. Mutations in the CAD gene can lead to significant metabolic and neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in human health and disease (Ng2015Biallelic).

## Function
The human gene CAD encodes a multifunctional protein that is essential for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, a critical pathway for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. This protein combines the activities of three enzymes: carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 (CPS2), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), and dihydroorotase (DHOase), which are responsible for the first three steps in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. These steps involve the conversion of bicarbonate and glutamine into carbamoyl phosphate, then into carbamyl aspartate, and finally into dihydroorotate (Ng2015Biallelic).

CAD is primarily active in the cytoplasm of cells, where it catalyzes these reactions. The production of nucleotides such as uridine triphosphate (UTP) and cytosine triphosphate (CTP) by this pathway is vital not only for nucleic acid synthesis but also for other cellular processes. For instance, UTP is a precursor for UDP nucleotide sugars like UDP-glucose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which are essential for glycosylation, a process crucial for protein function and cellular communication (Ng2015Biallelic).

Mutations in CAD can impair this biosynthetic pathway, leading to a decrease in these critical metabolites, which affects cell growth and viability. This underscores the importance of CAD in maintaining adequate nucleotide pools necessary for cell survival and proliferation (Ng2015Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAD gene, which is essential for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, are linked to several severe metabolic and neurological disorders. Notably, pathogenic autosomal recessive variants in CAD can lead to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and a congenital disorder of glycosylation, treatable with dietary uridine supplements (del2020Cell-based). These conditions manifest with symptoms such as developmental delays, seizures, and anemia, which have been shown to improve with uridine treatment (Peng2022A).

Additionally, CAD mutations are associated with a congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II-like hematological phenotype, characterized by mild anemia and marked anisopoikolocytosis. Treatment with oral uridine has been effective in managing these hematological and neurological phenotypes (Russo2020Uridine). The clinical significance of CAD is further underscored by its role in various cellular dysfunctions due to impaired pyrimidine biosynthesis, impacting nucleotide homeostasis crucial for cell growth and proliferation (Ng2015Biallelic).

Research has also identified CAD deficiency in individuals presenting with neurological involvement, developmental delays, and seizures, confirming the critical role of CAD in neurological and developmental health (del2020Cell-based). These findings highlight the potential of targeted therapies like uridine supplementation to mitigate the effects of CAD mutations, offering hope for affected individuals.

## Interactions
The CAD gene is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its transcription and function. The Brg1-based hSWI/SNF complex, which includes subunits such as mSin3A and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), is recruited to the CAD gene promoter. This complex is associated with the type II arginine-specific methyltransferase PRMT5, which methylates hypoacetylated histones H3 and H4, influencing transcriptional repression (Pal2003mSin3A/Histone). Additionally, the transcription factor c-Myc plays a crucial role in the transcriptional activation of the CAD gene by binding to a conserved E box sequence downstream of the transcription start site. This interaction is significant in proliferating cells and involves the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), a process essential for transcriptional elongation (Eberhardy2001c-Myc). c-Myc also interacts with the P-TEFb complex, specifically cyclin T1, to stimulate transcription of the CAD gene (Eberhardy2002Myc). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving multiple protein complexes and transcription factors that govern the expression and function of the CAD gene, crucial for cell growth and proliferation.
