# PER2

## Overview
The PER2 gene encodes the period circadian regulator 2 protein, a pivotal component of the human circadian clock system. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of circadian rhythms, which are intrinsic 24-hour cycles governing physiological and behavioral processes. The PER2 protein functions within the circadian transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL), acting as a negative regulator by interacting with other core clock proteins to maintain and stabilize the circadian cycle. Structurally, it features multiple functional domains that facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, essential for its regulatory functions in the clock mechanism. The protein's activity and stability are modulated by various post-translational modifications, which are critical for the timing and robustness of the circadian rhythms (Hirano2016The; Schmutz2010The).

## Structure
The PER2 protein, encoded by the PER2 gene, plays a crucial role in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Structurally, PER2 contains tandem PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which are essential for its function. These domains facilitate the formation of both homo- and heterodimers, crucial for the protein's role in the circadian transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL) (Militi2016Early; Merbitz-Zahradnik2015How). The PAS-B domain is particularly notable for forming antiparallel homodimers through its Î²-sheet surfaces and includes a conserved tryptophan residue critical for dimerization (Merbitz-Zahradnik2015How).

Additionally, PER2 features a Nuclear Export Sequence (NES) located C-terminal to the PAS-B domain, which is engaged in homodimer contacts and likely influences the function of the NES in the circadian clock (Merbitz-Zahradnik2015How). The protein also contains an LXXLL coactivator motif in the Î²E strand of PAS-A, involved in binding to nuclear receptors such as REV-ERBa and PPARa, suggesting its involvement in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (Merbitz-Zahradnik2015How).

Post-translational modifications of PER2 include phosphorylation by CKIÎµ and PKCÎ±, which regulate nuclear localization and cytosolic retention, respectively. O-GlcNAcylation at specific serine clusters competes with phosphorylation, influencing PER2's stability and repressor activity (Hirano2016The). These modifications are crucial for the functional regulation of PER2 in the circadian clock system.

## Function
The PER2 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the circadian clock in humans, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of circadian rhythms which are the natural cycles of physiological and behavioral phenomena that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle. The PER2 protein is involved in a negative feedback loop essential for maintaining this circadian rhythm. It functions by being activated by CLOCK/BMAL1 complexes, which bind to E-box elements in the promoter regions of PER2, leading to its transcription. After a delay, the PER2 protein accumulates in the nucleus and acts to inhibit its own activation by interfering with the CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transcription, thus contributing to the timing and stability of the circadian cycle (Xu2007Modeling).

Additionally, PER2 can activate the transcription of another clock gene, Bmal1, influencing the amplitude and phase of circadian rhythms. The stability and degradation of PER2 protein are also significant in determining the period length of the circadian clock, which is influenced by processes such as phosphorylation. Specifically, phosphorylation at certain sites on PER2 can lead to either increased transcription or degradation of the protein, thereby affecting the overall circadian rhythm (Xu2007Modeling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PER2 gene have been linked to various sleep disorders, including Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) and Familial Advanced Sleep-Phase Syndrome (FASPS). A specific low-frequency missense variant in the PER2 gene is strongly associated with DSWPD in a Japanese population, and this variant also shows a connection to idiopathic hypersomnia, a condition characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and phase delay tendencies (Miyagawa2019A). Additionally, the PER2 S662G mutation is associated with FASPS, where it causes early sleep onset and wakefulness (Gu2011The).

Beyond sleep-related disorders, alterations in PER2 expression and mutations have significant implications in cancer biology. Decreased expression of PER2 is associated with the progression and poor prognosis of various cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma and liver cancer. This pattern suggests that PER2 may function as a tumor suppressor gene, influencing tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation (Xiong2017Loss; Mteyrek2016Clock). Furthermore, the PER2 S662G mutation has been shown to enhance resistance to X-ray-induced apoptosis and increase oncogenic transformation, linking it to tumorigenesis (Gu2011The).

PER2 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the PER2 gene influencing susceptibility to SLE (Dan2021Association). This highlights the broader role of PER2 in regulating immune responses and inflammation, further underscoring its clinical significance in a range of disorders beyond the circadian rhythm.

## Interactions
PER2 (period circadian regulator 2) interacts with a variety of nuclear receptors and other proteins, playing a significant role in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Notably, PER2 has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with nuclear receptors such as REV-ERBa, PPARa, HNF4a, and TRa, indicating direct physical interactions that vary in strength and are influenced by the circadian cycle (Schmutz2010The). These interactions are mediated by interaction motifs in PER2, including CoRNR and LXXLL, which are structurally conserved and crucial for its function in gene regulation (Schmutz2010The).

Additionally, PER2 forms complexes with other core circadian proteins such as CRY1, CLOCK, and BMAL1. The interaction with CRY1 is particularly critical, as it influences the nuclear localization and stability of PER2, thereby regulating its function in the circadian rhythm (Yagita2002Nucleocytoplasmic). PER2 also binds to CLOCK and BMAL1, affecting the expression of genes like Bmal1 and Pepck1, which are involved in metabolic pathways (Schmutz2010The).

These interactions highlight the central role of PER2 in the molecular mechanisms governing the circadian clock, where it acts not only as a regulator of gene expression but also as a mediator of protein-protein interactions that are essential for maintaining the circadian cycle.
