# GPER1

## Overview
GPER1, short for G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1, is a gene that encodes the protein G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is pivotal in mediating the non-genomic signaling effects of estrogen, which include rapid cellular responses such as activation of signaling pathways and modulation of ion channel activity, distinct from the classical gene transcription pathways mediated by nuclear estrogen receptors (Filardo2012Minireview:). GPER1 is expressed in various tissues and plays significant roles in physiological processes including cardiovascular function, nervous system regulation, and metabolic processes. The receptor's ability to interact with a broad range of signaling molecules and its involvement in diverse cellular functions highlight its importance in health and disease (Luo2020Does; Khan2020G).

## Structure
GPER1, or G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1, is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, specifically classified under class A. The core structure of GPER1 includes seven transmembrane (7-TM) hydrophobic alpha-helices, which is highly conserved among GPCRs in the same class (Khan2020G). This receptor is involved in rapid non-genomic responses to estrogens, such as kinase activation and calcium mobilization, which are mediated through its interaction with G proteins (Bruno2016Homology).

The molecular structure of GPER1 has been explored through homology modeling, as the detailed structural information is limited due to the absence of its resolved X-ray crystal structure. Homology modeling has been crucial in understanding the binding modes of various modulators and in the identification of new ligands for GPER1 (Khan2020G). The receptor's interaction with ligands involves specific amino acid residues within the transmembrane domains, which are crucial for binding specificity and selectivity towards its agonists and antagonists (Khan2020G).

Despite the insights provided by homology modeling, the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of GPER1 are not explicitly detailed in the available literature. Similarly, information on specific domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms is not provided in the context provided.

## Function
GPER1, also known as G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1, is a receptor that plays a crucial role in the non-genomic signaling pathways triggered by estrogen (E2). This receptor is involved in rapid signaling events that do not directly involve changes in gene transcription. Upon binding with estrogen, GPER1 activates various second messengers and cytoplasmic signal transduction cascades, which are critical for cellular responses (Luo2020Does). GPER1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, and its expression can vary with factors such as age, species, and gender (Luo2020Does).

In the cardiovascular system, GPER1 mediates the vasodilatory effects of estrogen, contributes to blood pressure regulation, and offers protection against cardiovascular diseases like hypertension and atherosclerosis. It promotes the production of nitric oxide from endothelial cells, enhancing vessel dilation and inhibiting oxidative stress in cardiovascular cells (Luo2020Does). In the nervous system, GPER1 supports neuroprotection and cognitive functions, improving neuron survival and potentially playing a role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Luo2020Does).

Additionally, GPER1 has been identified in various intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nuclear membrane, and mitochondria, suggesting its diverse roles in cellular signaling that may vary by tissue type and environmental conditions (Luo2020Does). This receptor's ability to initiate signaling intracellularly and its distinct binding affinities compared to classical estrogen receptors underline its unique and essential role in mediating estrogenic effects in cells (Luo2020Does).

## Clinical Significance
GPER1, also known as G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1, is implicated in various cancers and its expression levels or mutations significantly influence disease progression and prognosis. In breast cancer, GPER1 expression varies with cancer subtype, influencing responses to therapy and correlating with tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive cancers. Its overexpression in triple-negative breast cancer contributes to invasiveness and poor outcomes (Muhammad2022Comparative). In gastric and colorectal cancers, decreased expression of GPER1 is associated with poor prognosis and lower survival rates, respectively (Muhammad2022Comparative). Additionally, GPER1 plays a role in thyroid cancer, where its expression is generally low in papillary thyroid carcinoma due to BRAF mutations, suggesting a complex role in thyroid cancer progression (Muhammad2022Comparative).

Polymorphisms in the GPER1 gene, specifically rs3808350 and rs3808351, are linked to cancer susceptibility, particularly in the Asian population. The A allele of rs3808351 exhibits protective effects against cancer, correlating with a lower risk of developing cancer and smaller tumor sizes (Ulhaq2021Association). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GPER1 in cancer biology, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and its role in cancer susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
GPER1, also known as G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1, engages in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and function. It activates ERK1/2 through the transactivation of the EGFR, a process involving the metalloproteinase-mediated release of HB-EGF. This interaction is facilitated by the Î±5Î²1 integrin and sphingosine kinase during EGFR transactivation (Prossnitz2014Estrogen). GPER1 also forms a complex with EGFR at the cyclin D1 promoter, indicating a direct interaction with DNA (Prossnitz2014Estrogen).

In addition to these interactions, GPER1 associates with cytokeratin (CK) intermediate filaments, specifically CK7 and CK8, suggesting a mechanism for the subcellular redistribution of the receptor after endocytosis (SandÃ©n2010G). This receptor also interacts with various signaling proteins such as GÎ±s, leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent accumulation of cAMP (Filardo2012Minireview:). Furthermore, GPER1 is involved in the recruitment of Î²-arrestin2 to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for its signaling pathways (SandÃ©n2010G).

These interactions underline the multifaceted role of GPER1 in mediating not only intracellular signaling but also its involvement in gene regulation and protein trafficking within cells.
