# TMEM50A

## Overview
TMEM50A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 50A, a protein characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes including gene regulation, mRNA stability, and intracellular trafficking. This protein is primarily localized to the plasma membrane but is also present in other cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles, Golgi bodies, and mitochondria. TMEM50A plays a crucial role in the regulation of the RH blood group antigens, including RHD and RHCE, which are key determinants of blood type. The protein's structure includes four transmembrane domains, which facilitate its interaction with the cellular membrane and contribute to its function in protein sorting and regulatory mechanisms (Srivastava2017Linear). Additionally, TMEM50A is implicated in the development of the embryonic nervous system, indicating its importance in broader biological processes (Chen2021Preliminary).

## Structure
The TMEM50A protein is characterized by a molecular structure that includes four transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its localization to the secretory pathway. These domains suggest a significant role in the protein's interaction with the cellular membrane (Srivastava2017Linear). The protein consists of 157 residues and its sequence was derived from the NCBI database, indicating a detailed understanding of its primary structure (Srivastava2017Linear).

Regarding post-translational modifications, TMEM50A undergoes phosphorylation at two serine residues, specifically at positions 82 and 84. It also has a potential N-linked glycosylation site at residue 74 and a possible tyrosine phosphorylation site, which are critical for regulating its activity and function (Srivastava2017Linear).

The tertiary structure of TMEM50A was modeled using a template with PDB ID: 3um7A, and the model suggests a stable structure with low root mean square deviation (RMSD) and minimal root mean square fluctuations, indicating a compact and stable three-dimensional conformation (Srivastava2017Linear).

No specific information is available on the quaternary structure or prominent folds from the provided contexts. Similarly, details on splice variant isoforms are not discussed in the available literature excerpts.

## Function
TMEM50A, encoded by the gene SMP1, is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes related to gene regulation and mRNA stability. It is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and is also found in the endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles, Golgi bodies, and mitochondria, suggesting its involvement in various cellular functions including protein sorting and intracellular trafficking (Srivastava2017Linear). The protein is involved in the regulation of the RH genes, specifically RHD and RHCE, which are crucial for blood type determination. Overexpression of TMEM50A has been shown to up-regulate RHCE gene activity, while its inhibition leads to decreased expression of both RHCE and RHD. This indicates that TMEM50A may influence the stability of RH mRNA through its splicing activities (Chen2021Preliminary). Despite these regulatory functions, overexpression of TMEM50A does not significantly alter the ammonium transport function in cells, highlighting its specific regulatory roles over general transport functions (Chen2021Preliminary). Additionally, TMEM50A is implicated in the development of the embryonic nervous system, suggesting broader biological implications beyond its interaction with RH genes (Chen2021Preliminary).

## Interactions
TMEM50A, encoded by the human gene TMEM50A, has been studied for its interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of molecular docking with predicted T-cell epitopes of the HPV type 16 E7 antigen. The structural model of TMEM50A was used to dock these epitopes, utilizing computational tools to predict their structures and interactions. This study highlighted the potential of TMEM50A to interact with specific protein segments, suggesting its role in immune response mechanisms against HPV infections (Srivastava2017Linear).

Additionally, TMEM50A has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression related to the RH genes, specifically RHD and RHCE, which are crucial for blood type determination. Overexpression of TMEM50A up-regulates RHCE gene activity, while its inhibition decreases the expression of both RHCE and RHD. This indicates that TMEM50A may influence these genes through regulatory interactions, affecting their transcription and possibly playing a role in embryonic nervous system development (Chen2021Preliminary).

These findings collectively suggest that TMEM50A is involved in both direct protein-protein interactions and indirect regulatory roles, influencing cellular functions and immune responses.
