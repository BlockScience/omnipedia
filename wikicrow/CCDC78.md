# CCDC78

## Overview
CCDC78 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 78, which is primarily involved in skeletal muscle function and integrity. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, suggesting a role in the oligomerization of large protein complexes, a common feature in proteins that participate in various cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton organization, and cell signaling pathways. CCDC78 is localized to critical areas in muscle cells, including the perinuclear region and the sarcolemmal membrane, and plays a significant role in excitation-contraction coupling, a fundamental process in muscle contractions. The interaction of the CCDC78 protein with RyR1, a key calcium channel in muscle cells, underscores its importance in muscle cell function and highlights its potential involvement in muscle-related diseases (Mohar2024The; Majczenko2012Dominant).

## Function
CCDC78, encoded by the CCDC78 gene, is a protein that plays a significant role in skeletal muscle function and structure. It is localized to the perinuclear region, along the sarcolemmal membrane, and in a reticular pattern within the sarcoplasm of muscle cells. This localization is crucial as it overlaps with the triad, a key structure in muscle cells involved in excitation-contraction coupling, suggesting a potential role for CCDC78 in this process (Majczenko2012Dominant). The protein's interaction with RyR1, a critical component of the excitation-contraction coupling machinery, further supports its involvement in muscle function (Majczenko2012Dominant).

In addition to its role in muscle cells, CCDC78 is implicated in the structural integrity of the triad, indicating its importance in maintaining proper muscle cell function (Mohar2024The). The coiled-coil domain of CCDC78 suggests it may participate in the oligomerization of large protein complexes, essential for cellular structure and function (Mohar2024The). This structural motif is common in proteins involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton organization, and cell signaling pathways, highlighting the potential broader implications of CCDC78 in cell biology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC78 gene have been linked to a unique form of congenital myopathy characterized by prominent internal nuclei and atypical core-like areas in muscle biopsies. This condition presents with symptoms such as neonatal hypotonia, distal greater than proximal weakness, excessive fatigue, and mild-to-moderate overall motor impairment while preserving ambulation. The disease exhibits an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern. Genetic analysis in a family displaying these symptoms revealed a splice-acceptor variant in the CCDC78 gene, which was not present in unaffected family members or in over 10,000 controls. This mutation leads to altered RNA transcript processing and results in a 222 bp in-frame insertion. The pathological features observed in muscle biopsies from affected individuals include marked type I fiber predominance, fiber-size variability, excessive central nuclei, core-like areas, and immunopositive aggregates for actin and desmin. Ultrastructural analysis showed disrupted contractile apparatus, loss of normal sarcomeric striation, and abnormalities in mitochondria and T-tubules (Majczenko2012Dominant).

Additionally, a study identified a missense variant in CCDC78 (c.712A>C; p.Lys238Gln) that may interact with an LMNA mutation to exacerbate muscle disease. This variant, although common in the population, was associated with muscle core pathology in profoundly affected family members, suggesting a role in the severity and possibly the spectrum of muscle diseases observed in these individuals (Mohar2024The).

## Interactions
CCDC78 interacts physically with the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), a calcium channel protein that also localizes to the triad in skeletal muscle cells. This interaction is particularly evident in muscle cores of individuals with a genetic variant in CCDC78, where both proteins colocalize, suggesting a role for CCDC78 in the mislocalization or aggregation of RyR1 within these structures. The presence of RyR1 in muscle cores alongside CCDC78 indicates a specific and potentially disruptive interaction between these proteins, rather than a general aggregation of misfolded proteins, as evidenced by the absence of the autophagy chaperone protein p62 in these cores (Mohar2024The).

Further studies have shown that variants in CCDC78 can lead to the mislocalization of RyR1, supporting the notion that CCDC78 is crucial for the proper localization and function of RyR1 in muscle cells. This interaction is significant as it may affect calcium homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling, essential processes for muscle function (Mohar2024The).

Additionally, the interaction between CCDC78 and RyR1 appears to be exacerbated in the presence of an LMNA mutation, leading to more severe skeletal muscle disease phenotypes and the formation of muscle cores in affected individuals (Mohar2024The).
