# GFM1

## Overview
GFM1 is a gene located in the human genome that encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor, G elongation factor mitochondrial 1 (mtEF-G1). This protein is pivotal in the mitochondrial protein synthesis process, specifically during the elongation phase of translation. mtEF-G1 is a GTPase that facilitates the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site on the ribosome, a critical step necessary for the synthesis of proteins within mitochondria. These proteins play essential roles in various cellular processes, including energy production through oxidative phosphorylation, regulation of apoptosis, and cellular metabolism. Mutations in the GFM1 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial dysfunction with significant clinical implications, particularly affecting neurological and hepatic systems (Wang2021Mitochondrial; Simon2017Activation).

## Structure
The GFM1 protein, also known as mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (mtEF-G1), is a complex molecular machine essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. The protein consists of 751 amino acids and includes five Pfam domains, which are crucial for its function in the mitochondrial translation process (Su2020Clinical). The primary structure of GFM1 reveals a sequence homology of about 45% with its bacterial counterpart, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this protein (Wang2021Mitochondrial).

GFM1 undergoes significant conformational changes mediated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, essential for its function in translocating peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosomal A site to the P site during peptide bond formation (Su2020Clinical). The protein interacts with the 50S large ribosomal subunit, specifically near the L7/L12 stalk and the sarcin-ricin region of 23S rRNA, which are critical for its role in peptide elongation (Su2020Clinical).

Details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of GFM1, as well as post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature. Therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate these aspects of the GFM1 protein structure.

## Function
The GFM1 gene encodes the mitochondrial elongation factor mtEF-G1, which is crucial for protein synthesis within mitochondria. This protein is involved in the elongation phase of mitochondrial protein translation, aiding in the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site of the ribosome. This step is essential for the proper synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, which are integral to various cellular functions including energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), regulation of apoptosis, and cellular metabolism (Wang2021Mitochondrial).

mtEF-G1 functions as a translational GTPase, utilizing the energy from GTP hydrolysis to facilitate the rearrangement of pre-translocation ribosomes and the movement of tRNA, thus accelerating the translocation process. Structural studies using Cryo-EM have shown that mtEF-G1 controls conformational changes in the small subunit (SSU) of the ribosome to promote tRNA movement and causes large rearrangements in the GTPase-associated center of the mitochondrial large subunit (LSU). This binding leads to the closure of the GAC, which stabilizes mtEF-G1 from a weakly to a tightly bound state with translocation capability (Wang2021Mitochondrial). 

Overall, the activity of GFM1 is vital for mitochondrial health and overall cellular energy homeostasis, playing a critical role in the synthesis of proteins that are essential for the mitochondrial function and energy production in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GFM1 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor mtEFG1, are associated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction leading to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. This condition manifests in a spectrum of severe clinical outcomes, predominantly affecting neurological and hepatic systems. Patients with GFM1 mutations often present with symptoms such as encephalopathy, liver disease, lactic acidosis, and failure to thrive, with many cases resulting in early death (Su2020Clinical; Simon2017Activation; Brito2015Long-term).

Specifically, mutations in GFM1 have been linked to diverse phenotypes including epilepsy, mental retardation, axial hypotonia, dystonia, and West syndrome. Neurological involvement is typically more pronounced, with brain MRI findings frequently showing abnormalities in basal ganglia, brainstem, and periventricular white matter (Barcia2019Clinical; You2020A). Additionally, some patients exhibit renal and hepatic complications, which are not as commonly reported but indicate the widespread impact of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by GFM1 mutations (Su2020Clinical).

The prognosis for patients with GFM1 mutations is generally poor, with most not surviving beyond infancy. This is attributed to the critical role of the GFM1-encoded protein in mitochondrial translation and energy production, essential for the function of high-energy demanding organs like the brain and liver (Balasubramaniam2011Infantile; Brito2015Long-term). Early genetic diagnosis and intensive medical care can improve survival in some cases, highlighting the importance of awareness and research on this gene (Su2020Clinical).

## Interactions
GFM1, encoded by the GFM1 gene, is a mitochondrial translation elongation factor that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It interacts with mitochondrial ribosomes to facilitate the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosomal acceptor site to the peptidyl site, a key step in protein synthesis. This process involves the removal of deacylated tRNA and the advancement of mRNA by one codon, exposing the next codon for translation (Brito2015Long-term).

Mutations in GFM1 can disrupt its interaction with other proteins, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. For instance, the Arg250Trp mutation affects the protein's structure and its ability to interact with other components of the mitochondrial translation machinery, potentially impacting the assembly of OXPHOS complexes (Smits2010Mutation). Additionally, the protein's interaction with mitoribosomes is crucial for its function, and its overabundance due to ClpP inactivity suggests a pathway for the pathogenesis of Perrault syndrome (Key2021Inactivity).

Overall, GFM1's interactions with mitochondrial ribosomes and its role in the mitochondrial translation process are essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production within cells.
