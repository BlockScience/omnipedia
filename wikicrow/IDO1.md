# IDO1

## Overview
IDO1, or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, is a gene that encodes for the heme-containing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1. This enzyme is crucial in the catabolism of the amino acid tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway, playing a significant role in immune regulation and response to infection. IDO1 is expressed in various tissues, particularly within the immune system, where it modulates immune tolerance and inflammation through the degradation of tryptophan and the production of kynurenine metabolites. These metabolites can influence immune cell function and are involved in the suppression of T cell activity and the promotion of regulatory T cell development. The enzyme's activity is also essential in antimicrobial defense, highlighting its dual role in both immune regulation and pathogen resistance (Arefayene2009Identification; NiÃ±o-Castro2013The).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the IDO1 protein, encoded by the human gene IDO1, is characterized by its division into two distinct domains: a smaller N-terminal domain (NTD) and a larger C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD is composed of six alpha-helices, two short beta-sheets, and three 3_10 helices, while the CTD consists of thirteen alpha-helices and two 3_10 helices (Lewis-Ballester2017Structural; Tang2021Indoleamine). These domains are connected by numerous hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Tang2021Indoleamine).

The CTD of IDO1 is particularly notable for containing the active site, where the substrate tryptophan binds. This binding induces the transformation of part of the JK-Loop into a beta-hairpin structure, which is crucial for the enzyme's function (Lewis-Ballester2017Structural). The heme prosthetic group, essential for the enzyme's dioxygenase activity, is located between the NTD and CTD, with His346 playing a significant role in heme-protein interactions (Lancellotti2011Biochemical).

While the primary structure of IDO1 consists of 403 amino acids, details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not specified in the provided contexts. Additionally, no information on quaternary structure is available from the given sources.

## Function
IDO1 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the catabolism of the amino acid tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway, which is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and regulating immune responses. This enzyme catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine. IDO1 is widely expressed in both immune and non-immune tissues, including dendritic cells and macrophages, where it is induced upon exposure to interferons or infection with various pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites (Arefayene2009Identification; NiÃ±o-Castro2013The).

The activity of IDO1 leads to local depletion of tryptophan and an increase in kynurenine metabolites, which can suppress effector T cell function and promote the development of regulatory T cells. This suppression is achieved through mechanisms such as the induction of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in T cells (Arefayene2009Identification; Merlo2020Differential). Additionally, the kynurenine pathway metabolites activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), influencing further immune regulation (Merlo2020Differential).

In the context of infections, IDO1's enzymatic activity is essential for antimicrobial defense, particularly against pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes, by producing metabolites that have direct antimicrobial properties (NiÃ±o-Castro2013The). This role highlights IDO1's importance not only in immune regulation but also in cellular defense mechanisms against infections.

## Clinical Significance
IDO1 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) gene mutations and alterations in expression have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. In Crohn's Disease (CD), genetic variants of IDO1 are associated with a more severe disease course, characterized by a higher likelihood of extraintestinal manifestations and a need for aggressive treatment (Lee2014IDO1). Similarly, in colorectal cancer (CRC), high IDO1 expression correlates with more aggressive cancer phenotypes and poorer clinical outcomes, suggesting its role in immune evasion by cancer cells (Chen2016Expression).

IDO1 also plays a crucial role in the immune response to infections. For instance, polymorphisms in IDO1 affect susceptibility to aspergillosis in patients with cystic fibrosis and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, where reduced IDO1 function due to specific SNPs correlates with increased inflammatory responses (Napolioni2019Genetic). Additionally, IDO1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for diabetic nephropathy, with its expression levels significantly increased in this condition, correlating with immune cell infiltration and disease progression (Yu2021IDO1).

These findings underscore the importance of IDO1 in various pathological conditions and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
IDO1 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) does not have documented interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids based on the provided excerpts. The research primarily focuses on the enzyme's interaction with small molecule inhibitors and its role in the immune system, particularly in the context of cancer immunology. The studies detailed involve the inhibition of IDO1 activity through various compounds, analyzing the enzyme's binding with these inhibitors and the subsequent effects on immune cell function and tumor growth. For instance, specific amino acids such as Ser167 are crucial for the binding of inhibitors to IDO1, affecting the enzyme's activity and its role in immune suppression (Tomek2017Discovery). However, these interactions are limited to the enzyme's relationship with inhibitors and do not extend to interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to describe multiprotein complexes or transitory interactions involving IDO1 with other proteins or nucleic acids.
