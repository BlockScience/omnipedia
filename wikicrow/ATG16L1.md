# ATG16L1

## Overview
ATG16L1 is a gene that encodes the protein autophagy related 16 like 1, which plays a pivotal role in the autophagy pathway, a critical process for cellular degradation and recycling. The ATG16L1 protein is involved in the formation of the autophagosome by interacting with ATG5 and ATG12 to facilitate the expansion of the autophagosomal membrane. This protein is characterized by several domains including an N-terminal ATG5-binding domain, a central coiled-coil domain for oligomerization, and a C-terminal WD40 domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions and is unique to the mammalian version of the protein (Bajagic2017Structure). The gene and its protein product are essential not only for autophagy but also play roles in immune response regulation and cellular homeostasis, making them significant in both health and disease contexts (Hamaoui2021ATG16L1).

## Structure
The ATG16L1 protein, encoded by the ATG16L1 gene, is a multifaceted protein involved in the autophagy pathway, crucial for cellular homeostasis and response to pathogens. Structurally, ATG16L1 is composed of several distinct domains that contribute to its function in autophagy. The protein consists of an N-terminal ATG5-binding domain, essential for interaction with the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate, a central coiled-coil domain (CCD) that facilitates oligomerization through homo-dimerization, and a C-terminal WD40 domain, which is unique to mammalian ATG16L1 and absent in yeast. This WD40 domain forms a seven-bladed propeller structure, each blade comprising a canonical anti-parallel beta-sheet, and is involved in various protein-protein interactions (Bajagic2017Structure).

The ATG16L1 protein also exhibits multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which introduces variations primarily in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, affecting the protein's function and interaction capabilities. For instance, some isoforms lack certain exons or include alterations in the amino acid sequence, which can influence the protein's structural conformation and its role in autophagy (Jiang2013Three).

Furthermore, the ATG16L1 protein interacts with several other proteins crucial for autophagy, such as WIPI2 and Rab33, through its coiled-coil domain. This domain is not only pivotal for protein-protein interactions but also for the recruitment of ATG16L1 to autophagy initiation sites (Strong2021Structural; Metje-Sprink2020Crystal). The structural integrity and interaction capabilities of ATG16L1 are essential for its function in the autophagic process, highlighting the importance of its molecular architecture.

## Function
ATG16L1 (autophagy related 16 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein essential for the autophagy process, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by recycling organelles and protein aggregates. This protein, along with ATG5 and ATG12, forms a complex that is vital for the expansion of the autophagosomal membrane, a key step in autophagosome formation. The ATG12-ATG5/ATG16L1 complex serves as a noncanonical E3 ligase that attaches LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), anchoring LC3 to the target membrane and facilitating the growth of the phagophore and its closure to form the autophagosome (Hamaoui2021ATG16L1).

Beyond its role in canonical autophagy, ATG16L1 is involved in various cellular processes that contribute to cell biology and health. It plays a crucial role in modulating the innate immune response by generally acting to suppress inflammation, which is beneficial in preventing overactivation of inflammatory pathways (Hamaoui2021ATG16L1). Additionally, ATG16L1 is involved in secretory autophagy, crucial for the extracellular release of cytosolic cargo, and participates in non-autophagy related secretory pathways, such as hormone secretion in neuroendocrine cells and plasma membrane repair (Hamaoui2021ATG16L1).

ATG16L1 also interacts with the small GTPase Rab6 to regulate vesicle transport, crucial for cellular homeostasis and response to intracellular pathogens (Hamaoui2021ATG16L1). This gene's functions are vital in healthy cells, contributing to more than just the autophagy pathway and affecting various cellular processes and overall health.

## Clinical Significance
ATG16L1 mutations, particularly the T300A polymorphism, have been strongly linked to Crohn's disease (CD), a type of inflammatory bowel disease. Individuals carrying the T300A variant exhibit impaired autophagy, leading to decreased stability of the ATG16L1 protein and subsequent reductions in antibacterial autophagy. This impairment is associated with increased production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1Î², contributing to the inflammation observed in CD (Prescott2007A; Lassen2014Atg16L1). The T300A SNP is specifically associated with ileal Crohn's disease, indicating a significant role of ATG16L1 in the pathogenesis of this disease subtype (Prescott2007A).

Beyond Crohn's disease, ATG16L1 polymorphisms have implications in other health conditions. For instance, the T300A variant has been associated with increased susceptibility to tuberculosis and severe sepsis in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, suggesting that ATG16L1 function affects the severity of these conditions by influencing autophagy and cytokine production (Savva2014Association). Additionally, the gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, although the association is less pronounced than with Crohn's disease (Prescott2007A).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ATG16L1 in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
ATG16L1 interacts with a variety of proteins that are crucial for the autophagy process. It forms a complex with ATG12 and ATG5, which is essential for autophagosome formation (Metje-Sprink2020Crystal). ATG16L1 also binds to the Golgi resident GTPase Rab33B through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain, an interaction critical for recruiting Golgi-derived vesicles to the growing isolation membrane during autophagy (Metje-Sprink2020Crystal). Additionally, ATG16L1 interacts with WIPI2b, a WD-repeat PtIns3P effector protein, important for the membrane recruitment of the ATG12-ATG5/ATG16L1 complex during early stages of starvation-induced autophagy (Metje-Sprink2020Crystal).

The interaction between ATG16L1 and Rab33B involves the coiled-coil domain of ATG16L1 and the switch regions of Rab33B, with specific residues forming hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds (Pantoom2020RAB33B). This interaction is necessary for LC3 lipidation, a critical process for autophagosome biogenesis (Pantoom2020RAB33B).

ATG16L1 also interacts with FIP200, a protein that, along with ATG13 and ULK1, forms part of the ULK complex essential for initiating autophagy under nutrient starvation conditions. This interaction does not require the presence of ATG5 or ATG13, indicating a direct binding between ATG16L1 and FIP200 (Gammoh2012Interaction).
