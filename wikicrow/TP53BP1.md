# TP53BP1

## Overview
TP53BP1 is a gene that encodes the tumor protein p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), which is a critical component of the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). The protein encoded by this gene is not an enzyme but serves as a scaffold protein that facilitates the assembly of several key proteins at sites of DNA damage, thereby influencing DNA repair pathways. 53BP1 has a multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability by mediating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks primarily through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway and regulating p53-dependent transcriptional responses to DNA damage (Rappold2001Tumor; Lei2022Multifaceted). This protein is essential for the activation of DNA damage checkpoints, preventing the replication of damaged DNA and thus playing a crucial role in cancer prevention and response to therapy (Cuella-Martin201653BP1).

## Structure
The TP53BP1 protein, also known as 53BP1, is a large scaffolding protein crucial for DNA damage response, particularly in the context of double-strand break (DSB) repair. The protein is composed of 1,972 amino acids and has a molecular mass of over 200 kDa. Structurally, TP53BP1 is divided into several key regions: the N-terminal region (1-1,220 amino acids), the minimal focus forming region (1,220-1,711 amino acids), and the C-terminal region (1,712-1,972 amino acids) (Lei2022Multifaceted).

The N-terminal region contains 28 Ser/Thr-Gln (S/T-Q) phosphorylation sites, which are crucial for mediating interactions with other proteins such as PTIP and RIF1 (Panier2013Double-strand). The minimal focus forming region includes two dynein light chain binding domains, an oligomerization domain, a glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) motif, two tandem Tudor domains, and a ubiquitylation-dependent recruitment (UdR) motif (Lei2022Multifaceted; Panier2013Double-strand). The C-terminal region features two BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal (BRCT) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, including binding to p53 and Î³H2AX, essential for DSB repair in heterochromatin (Lei2022Multifaceted).

Post-translational modifications of 53BP1 include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and acetylation, which are crucial for its function in DNA repair pathways (Lei2022Multifaceted). The Tudor domains specifically bind to dimethylated Lys20 of histone 4 (H4K20me2), and the BRCT domains interact with phosphorylated histone H2AX (Î³H2AX) to facilitate recruitment to DNA damage sites (Botuyan2006Structural).

Overall, the molecular structure of TP53BP1, characterized by its distinct domains and motifs, plays a significant role in its function in the DNA damage response, influencing its structural conformation and interaction dynamics at the molecular level.

## Function
TP53BP1, encoded by the TP53BP1 gene, is a critical protein in DNA damage response and repair mechanisms in human cells. It plays a pivotal role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, a primary method for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). TP53BP1 recognizes and binds to methylated and ubiquitinated histone marks at sites of DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment and stabilization of other repair proteins at break sites (Cuella-Martin201653BP1).

Additionally, TP53BP1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its transcriptional activity in response to DNA damage. This interaction is crucial for the activation of p53-dependent genes that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis, thereby maintaining genomic integrity and preventing tumorigenesis (Rappold2001Tumor; Cuella-Martin201653BP1).

The protein is also involved in cellular mechanisms that regulate DNA damage checkpoints and cell cycle progression. For instance, TP53BP1, in conjunction with USP28, activates the G1 checkpoint, preventing cells with damaged DNA from entering the S phase, which is essential for preventing the propagation of DNA errors (Cuella-Martin201653BP1).

In summary, TP53BP1 is integral to the cellular framework that maintains DNA integrity and cell viability under stress conditions, primarily through its roles in DNA repair and in modulating p53-dependent pathways.

## Clinical Significance
TP53BP1, encoded by the TP53BP1 gene, has been implicated in various cancers due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), high levels of 53BP1 protein and mRNA are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including reduced survival rates. This suggests its potential as an independent prognostic marker in HGSOC (Skulimowski202353BP1). Similarly, in breast cancer, reduced expression of TP53BP1 correlates with worse prognosis, particularly in triple-negative tumors and those with BRCA1 mutations (De2017DNA). The gene's role extends to influencing treatment responses; for instance, TP53BP1 expression levels affect sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs like carboplatin in ovarian cancer (Skulimowski202353BP1).

Furthermore, genetic variations in TP53BP1, such as specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been linked to increased breast cancer risk, especially in estrogen receptor-negative and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancers (Ma2005Joint). These findings underscore the importance of TP53BP1 in cancer susceptibility and progression, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions and as a marker for tailoring cancer treatments.

## Interactions
TP53BP1, also known as 53BP1, is a critical player in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It functions as a molecular scaffold that recruits various proteins to damaged chromatin, facilitating the repair process. TP53BP1 interacts with the ATM kinase, which phosphorylates it to aid in the recruitment of other proteins such as RIF1 and PTIP at DSB sites (Panier2013Double-strand). It also directly interacts with the RAD50 component of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, essential for recruiting ATM to DNA damage sites and promoting checkpoint signaling (Panier2013Double-strand).

The protein binds to ubiquitylated Lys15 of histone 2 (H2AK15ub) and dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2), particularly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, recruiting effector proteins like RIF1 and PTIP. These interactions mediate the formation of a complex that inhibits BRCA1 from associating with the MRN complex and CtIP, thereby favoring non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathways over homologous recombination (Panier2013Double-strand).

Furthermore, TP53BP1's interaction with ubiquitylated nucleosomes, particularly those ubiquitylated by RNF168, is critical for its accumulation at DSB sites. This interaction is facilitated by the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment domain (UDR) of TP53BP1, which does not affect its binding to H4K20me2 in isolation, highlighting its specific role in mediating interactions with ubiquitylated nucleosomes (Fradet-Turcotte201353BP1).
