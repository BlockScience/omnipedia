# GLO1

## Overview
GLO1 is a gene that encodes for the enzyme glyoxalase I, a critical detoxifying agent within the cell. Glyoxalase I, a homodimeric enzyme, plays a vital role in the glyoxalase system by catalyzing the conversion of methylglyoxalâa cytotoxic byproduct of glycolysisâinto the less harmful S-D-lactoylglutathione, in conjunction with glutathione. This reaction is essential for preventing the accumulation of methylglyoxal and the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are linked to various age-related diseases and diabetic complications (Rabbani2014Activity; Schalkwijk2020Methylglyoxal). The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues and is crucial in maintaining cellular health, particularly under conditions that elevate methylglyoxal production such as high glucose levels and oxidative stress (Schalkwijk2020Methylglyoxal). Glyoxalase I's activity and expression are regulated by various factors, including oxidative stress, which underscores its importance in cellular metabolism and stress response (Xue2012Transcriptional).

## Structure
Glyoxalase I (GLO1) is a homodimeric enzyme, meaning it consists of two identical subunits. Each subunit contributes to the formation of the active sites, which are crucial for the enzyme's catalytic function. The active sites are located at the dimer interface, involving interactions with an essential zinc ion (Zn2+) and side chains from both subunits. The zinc binding site includes residues such as Gln-33A, Glu-99A, His-126B, and Glu-172B, along with two water molecules in an octahedral coordination (Honek2015Glyoxalase; Thornalley2003Glyoxalase).

The primary structure of GLO1 consists of 184 amino acids. The enzyme undergoes several post-translational modifications which include the removal of the N-terminal methionine, N-terminal acetylation at alanine 2, formation of a vicinal disulfide bridge between cysteine residues 19 and 20, and glutathionylation at cysteine 139. These modifications play a role in regulating the enzyme's activity in response to the cellular redox state (Birkenmeier2010Posttranslational).

Structurally, GLO1 belongs to the Î²Î±Î²Î²Î² structural superfamily, a versatile framework that supports various functions across different proteins. This common fold is indicative of the enzyme's evolutionary adaptability and functional diversity (Honek2015Glyoxalase).

## Function
GLO1, or glyoxalase I, is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by the GLO1 gene, which plays a pivotal role in the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG), a byproduct of glycolysis known for its potential to glycate proteins and nucleic acids, leading to cellular dysfunction. The primary function of GLO1 is to catalyze the conversion of MG, in the presence of glutathione, into S-D-lactoylglutathione, a less harmful compound. This reaction is crucial in preventing the accumulation of MG and the subsequent formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are associated with various age-related diseases and diabetic complications (Rabbani2014Activity; Schalkwijk2020Methylglyoxal).

The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining cellular health, particularly under stress conditions such as high glucose levels, oxidative stress, or aging, where the production of MG is typically elevated. GLO1 is ubiquitously expressed across all tissues in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular metabolism (Schalkwijk2020Methylglyoxal). The transcriptional regulation of GLO1 is influenced by various factors, including the Nrf2 transcription factor, which enhances its expression in response to oxidative stress, thereby bolstering the cellular defense against dicarbonyl stress (Xue2012Transcriptional). This regulatory mechanism ensures an adaptive response to environmental and physiological stressors, safeguarding cellular proteins and DNA from damage and maintaining the functional integrity of the proteome and genome.

## Clinical Significance
GLO1 (glyoxalase I) mutations and alterations in expression have been implicated in a variety of diseases and conditions. In cancer, overexpression of GLO1 is observed in several malignancies such as squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma, where it is associated with increased tumor grade, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy (Zou2015Glyoxalase; Rabbani2018Multiple). Specifically, GLO1 gene amplification, which leads to increased expression, has been linked to poor prognosis in cancers like breast cancer and gastric cancer (Rabbani2018Multiple).

In neurological disorders, alterations in GLO1 expression or activity have been associated with conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, and restless legs syndrome. A frameshift mutation in GLO1 was found in a patient with schizophrenia, suggesting a role in this condition (Distler2012Role). Additionally, a coding SNP in GLO1 has been proposed to be associated with autism, although findings have been inconsistent (Distler2012Role).

Furthermore, GLO1's role in neuropathic pain, particularly in the context of diabetes, highlights its significance in non-neurological conditions as well. Variations in GLO1 expression or activity have been linked to differences in pain sensitivity and diabetic neuropathy (Distler2012Role). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GLO1 across a spectrum of diseases, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
GLO1 (glyoxalase I) interacts with various proteins, influencing cellular processes and disease pathology. In breast cancer cells, GLO1 has been shown to co-localize and potentially interact with protein kinase C lambda (PKCÎ»), suggesting a related function in cancer progression. This interaction is supported by observations of their co-localization in the cytosol and nucleus, and a significant correlation between their expression levels (Motomura2021Glyoxalase). Additionally, GLO1's interaction with PKCÎ» is implicated in maintaining cell viability and reducing apoptosis in breast cancer stem cells, highlighting its role in cancer cell survival (Motomura2021Glyoxalase).

In the context of malignant melanoma, GLO1 interacts with methylglyoxal to detoxify this glycolytic byproduct, thereby protecting cells from cytotoxic effects. This interaction is crucial for the survival of melanoma cells under high methylglyoxal stress (Bair2010GLO1). Furthermore, GLO1's activity affects the post-translational modification of heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), a process mediated by methylglyoxal. This modification likely alters Hsp27's function, implicating a specific interaction between GLO1 and Hsp27 in melanoma (Bair2010GLO1). These interactions underline the multifaceted roles of GLO1 in cellular defense and disease progression.
