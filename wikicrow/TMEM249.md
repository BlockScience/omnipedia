# TMEM249

## Overview
TMEM249 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane protein 249, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein plays a significant role in the structural and functional integrity of the CatSper channel complex within the sperm flagellum. The interactions facilitated by TMEM249 are crucial for calcium signaling pathways that are essential for sperm motility and overall reproductive function. The protein's involvement in these critical pathways highlights its importance in the physiological processes related to fertility and reproduction (Zhao20223D). Further studies on TMEM249 could provide deeper insights into its potential roles in other cellular processes and its implications in human health and disease (Zhao20223D).

## Interactions
TMEM249, identified as a transmembrane protein within the CatSpermasome of the sperm flagellum, is involved in crucial protein-protein interactions. Specifically, TMEM249 interacts at the dimeric interface of the CatSper channel complex, which is essential for the structural integrity and function of this complex. The amino acids Q61, R63, and T64 of TMEM249 are highlighted as critical points of interaction at this interface. These interactions are vital for the channel's role in calcium signaling, which is crucial for sperm motility and function (Zhao20223D).

Additionally, in the context of CatSper channel structural analysis, TMEM249 is suggested to potentially interact at the dimer interface of CatSper complexes. However, the exact interaction sites or residues involved remain incompletely characterized due to limitations in the atomic model used in the study (Zhao20223D).

These interactions underscore the functional importance of TMEM249 in the regulation of calcium sensitivity and pH-dependent activation of sperm, contributing to the overall reproductive process. The detailed visualization of these interactions was facilitated by advanced imaging techniques such as cryo-electron tomography and pseudo-atomic modeling.
