# PRKACA

## Overview
The PRKACA gene encodes the protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha (PKA C-alpha), a key enzyme in the cAMP signaling pathway. This kinase plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including metabolism, gene expression, and cell division by phosphorylating various substrates in response to cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. PRKACA is a serine/threonine kinase that forms the catalytic core of the PKA holoenzyme, which is activated upon cAMP binding to its regulatory subunits, leading to a cascade of cellular activities. The gene is also involved in multiple signaling pathways and interacts with several proteins, influencing cellular localization and functional dynamics of the kinase. Mutations and alterations in the expression of PRKACA have been linked to several diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Sato2014Recurrent; Turnham2016Protein).

## Structure
The molecular structure of PRKACA, also known as the catalytic subunit alpha of protein kinase A (PKA), is characterized by a conserved bilobal kinase core. This core consists of a smaller N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a larger C-terminal lobe (C-lobe). The N-lobe is rich in Î²-strands and is crucial for ATP binding, while the C-lobe, primarily composed of Î±-helices, is involved in substrate recognition and binding (SÃ¸berg2018The; Cao2018Structures). The two lobes are connected by a hinge region that houses the active site cleft, which binds ATP and two Mg2+ ions essential for the enzyme's function (SÃ¸berg2018The).

PRKACA undergoes several post-translational modifications that regulate its activity and interactions. These include phosphorylation, myristoylation, and deamidation. Phosphorylation of Thr197 within the activation loop is necessary for catalytic activity. Myristoylation at the N-terminal Gly residue is important for membrane localization and interaction dynamics, particularly influencing the enzyme's conformation and its interaction with regulatory subunits (Zhang2015An; Cembran2012Conformational).

The quaternary structure of PRKACA in its active form is part of a heterotetramer, known as the PKA holoenzyme, consisting of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. The regulatory subunits inhibit the catalytic activity until cAMP binds, triggering a conformational change that releases the catalytic subunits to phosphorylate downstream targets (Tomasini2018Conformational).

Additionally, PRKACA exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their N-terminal sequences affecting their regulatory mechanisms and localization (SÃ¸berg2017Evolution).

## Function
The PRKACA gene encodes the catalytic subunit alpha of protein kinase A (PKA), a crucial enzyme in the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. This pathway is vital for regulating various physiological processes, including metabolism, cell division, and gene expression. The protein kinase A holoenzyme, of which PRKACA is a part, is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. In its inactive state, the catalytic subunits are bound by regulatory subunits. Activation of PKA occurs when cyclic AMP (cAMP) binds to the regulatory subunits, leading to a conformational change that releases the active catalytic subunits. These free catalytic subunits then phosphorylate a range of downstream targets, influencing numerous cellular processes such as glucose homeostasis, cardiac function, and higher cognitive functions (Turnham2016Protein).

PRKACA specifically has three isoforms, with CÎ±1 being the primary form expressed in most tissues. This isoform plays a significant role in phosphorylating substrates like ion channels and cytoskeletal components, crucial for synaptic transmission and excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes. The coordinated action of calcium and cAMP signaling pathways, facilitated by PRKACA, is essential for proper cardiac function. Misregulation of PRKACA activity can lead to various diseases, including heart disease and Cushing's syndrome, where mutations in PRKACA result in increased basal activity of the kinase, contributing to the disease's pathology (Turnham2016Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKACA gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit alpha of protein kinase A (PKA), have been strongly linked to various forms of Cushing's syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive cortisol production. These mutations often result in the constitutive activation of PKA, leading to increased cortisol synthesis independent of the normal regulatory mechanisms. Specifically, the Leu206Arg mutation has been identified in a significant number of adrenal adenomas associated with overt Cushing's syndrome, indicating a direct role of PRKACA mutations in the pathogenesis of this disease (Zennaro2017Genetic; Sato2014Recurrent; Beuschlein2014Constitutive).

Additionally, germline duplications of PRKACA have been associated with bilateral adrenal hyperplasias and overt Cushing's syndrome, suggesting that both somatic mutations and copy-number variations in this gene contribute to adrenal dysfunction and hypercortisolism (Beuschlein2014Constitutive). The presence of PRKACA mutations correlates with more severe clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, including higher cortisol levels and smaller tumor diameters, compared to patients without these mutations (Sato2014Recurrent).

These findings underscore the critical role of PRKACA in the regulation of cortisol production and highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in adrenal diseases where PKA is abnormally activated.

## Interactions
PRKACA, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), interacts with various proteins to regulate cellular functions. It forms a holoenzyme with regulatory subunits (R subunits), which is activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP). This activation triggers a conformational change in the R subunits, releasing the catalytic subunits to phosphorylate downstream targets (Turnham2016Protein; Stratakis2018Cyclic). PRKACA also interacts with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which target the holoenzyme to specific subcellular locations, enhancing the efficiency and specificity of PKA signaling (Turnham2016Protein).

Mutations in PRKACA, such as the Leu206Arg substitution, disrupt its interaction with PRKAR1A, a regulatory subunit, leading to constitutive activation of PRKACA. This mutation is linked to increased PKA activity and is associated with cortisol-secreting adrenocortical adenomas (Tseng2017Microinsertions). Additionally, PRKACA is part of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion protein in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, where it retains interaction capabilities similar to the wild-type protein, influencing tumorigenesis (Kastenhuber2017DNAJB1âPRKACA). This fusion protein also interacts with Î²-catenin, affecting Wnt signaling and cellular proliferation (Kastenhuber2017DNAJB1âPRKACA).
