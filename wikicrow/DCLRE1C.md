# DCLRE1C

## Overview
The DCLRE1C gene encodes the DNA cross-link repair 1C protein, commonly known as ARTEMIS, which plays a pivotal role in DNA repair mechanisms and the immune system's development. ARTEMIS belongs to the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily and is characterized by its endonuclease activity, essential for V(D)J recombinationâa critical process in the maturation of T and B lymphocytesâand non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a key pathway for repairing double-strand breaks in DNA. Mutations in DCLRE1C can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other immunological disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability and immune competence (Felgentreff2015Functional; Zhang2023A).

## Structure
The DCLRE1C protein, also known as Artemis, is characterized by a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) domain and a beta-CASP (CPSF-Artemis-SNM1-Pso2) domain. The MBL domain is crucial for the endonuclease activity of the protein, which is essential for V(D)J recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair processes. The beta-CASP domain includes a unique second metal binding site that resembles a classical Cys2His2 zinc finger motif, which is important for protein stability and may serve as a small molecule binding site (Yosaatmadja2020Structure).

The catalytic domain of DCLRE1C, spanning amino acids 1-362, has been crystallized, revealing the active site free of ligands, which facilitates the soaking of small molecules like ceftriaxone. This structural data was obtained with a resolution better than 1.5 Ã, providing detailed insights into the protein's molecular architecture (Yosaatmadja2020Structure).

Post-translational modifications identified in Artemis include phosphorylation sites at S516 and S645, which are believed to modulate the nuclease activities of the protein. The phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs in the C-terminal region may relieve inhibition of the protein's endonucleolytic activities (Pannicke2010The).

Overall, the molecular structure of DCLRE1C, including its specific domains and post-translational modifications, plays a critical role in its function in DNA repair and V(D)J recombination.

## Function
The DCLRE1C gene encodes the ARTEMIS protein, which is a critical component in the V(D)J recombination process essential for the development of diverse antigen receptors in T and B lymphocytes. This process is crucial for generating the diversity of the immune response. ARTEMIS functions by opening hairpin structures formed at DNA ends during V(D)J recombination, a process initiated by the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins. These proteins create double-strand breaks by binding to recombination signal sequences adjacent to V, D, and J segments of DNA. Once the hairpins are opened by ARTEMIS, the DNA ends can be further processed before being sealed by the XRCC4/XLF/LIG4 complex (Pannicke2010The; Felgentreff2015Functional).

Additionally, ARTEMIS plays a significant role in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway for DNA double-strand break repair. This pathway is vital for modifying non-ligatable ends of DNA breaks that occur in a small fraction of DNA double-strand breaks after ionizing radiation exposure, thus maintaining genomic stability and preventing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) when functionally compromised (Felgentreff2015Functional).

ARTEMIS is part of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily and contains a beta-lactamase domain, a central beta-CASP domain, and a C-terminal region, which are essential for its catalytic function and stability (Felgentreff2015Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DCLRE1C gene, which encodes the ARTEMIS protein, are primarily associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a condition marked by a profound vulnerability to infections. Null mutations in DCLRE1C lead to a complete deficiency of ARTEMIS, resulting in a T-B-NK+ SCID phenotype, characterized by an absence of T and B lymphocytes but normal numbers of natural killer (NK) cells. This form of SCID is highly sensitive to ionizing radiation and typically manifests within the first year of life (Zhang2023A). Hypomorphic mutations, which allow for some residual ARTEMIS function, result in a "leaky" SCID with a milder initial presentation but can lead to severe and progressive immunodeficiency and increased risk of malignancies, including lymphomas, particularly those associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Zhang2023A; Nahum2020Unusual).

Additionally, specific mutations in DCLRE1C have been linked to Omenn Syndrome, characterized by erythematoexfoliative dermatitis, eosinophilia, and severe immunodeficiency, often resulting in early death if untreated (Cheraghi2023Omenn). The variability in clinical presentation among individuals with DCLRE1C mutations underscores the gene's critical role in immune system function and highlights the complexity of its impact on human health.

## Interactions
The DCLRE1C gene encodes the ARTEMIS protein, which is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in DNA repair and V(D)J recombination. ARTEMIS interacts with the DNA protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and DNA Ligase 4, both of which are crucial for its role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. These interactions facilitate the processing of DNA double-strand breaks, particularly in developing T and B lymphocytes (Felgentreff2015Functional). Additionally, ARTEMIS has been shown to interact with PAX transactivation domain-interacting protein (PTIP), a protein involved in the DNA repair pathway, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability (Felgentreff2015Functional).

Furthermore, the interaction of ARTEMIS with small molecule inhibitors has been studied, revealing a specific interaction between the metal center of the protein's active site and the cyclic 1,2 diamide functional group of ceftriaxone. This interaction involves a nickel ion, indicating a targeted physical interaction at the molecular level, which could influence the development of therapeutic strategies targeting ARTEMIS (Yosaatmadja2020Structure). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of ARTEMIS in cellular processes critical for immune system development and response to DNA damage.
