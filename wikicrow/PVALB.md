# PVALB

## Overview
The PVALB gene encodes the protein parvalbumin, a calcium-binding albumin protein that plays a crucial role in calcium signaling and regulation in various tissues, including muscle and nervous systems. Parvalbumin functions primarily as a cytosolic buffer, modulating intracellular calcium levels essential for processes such as muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release. It is particularly significant in fast-twitch muscle fibers and GABAergic interneurons, influencing muscle relaxation and neuronal excitability, respectively. The protein's interactions with other cellular components like calcium pumps and channels further underscore its role in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis. Alterations in the expression of PVALB have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease (Filice2020ThePH; YÃ¡Ã±ez2012Calcium; Schwaller2004Parvalbumin).

## Function
Parvalbumin (PVALB) is a calcium-binding protein that plays a critical role in various cellular and physiological processes by modulating intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels. It functions primarily as a cytosolic calcium buffer, helping to regulate the concentration of Ca2+ ions within cells, which is crucial for maintaining cellular functions such as muscle contraction and relaxation, and neurotransmitter release in neurons (Filice2020ThePH; YÃ¡Ã±ez2012Calcium).

In muscle cells, PVALB facilitates the relaxation of fast-contracting muscles by shuttling Ca2+ from troponin C to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby accelerating the contraction-relaxation cycle. This role is particularly vital in fast-twitch muscle fibers, contributing to rapid and phasic movements (Arif2009A). In the nervous system, PVALB is expressed predominantly in GABAergic interneurons, where it influences neuronal excitability and the timing of neurotransmitter release. It helps maintain the excitatory-inhibitory balance crucial for normal brain function and preventing neurological disorders such as epilepsy (Filice2020ThePH; Schwaller2004Parvalbumin).

Additionally, PVALB is involved in endocrine regulation, where it is implicated in the calcium-dependent production of hormones like testosterone, essential for reproductive functions (Arif2009A). Its expression in various endocrine glands suggests a broader role in endocrine secretions across different tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PVALB gene, which encodes the parvalbumin protein, have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), reduced expression of PVALB is associated with diminished social behaviors in mouse models, suggesting a causal relationship between PV levels and ASD-like behaviors (Filice2020ThePH). Similar findings in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder indicate a common mechanism involving PV across these conditions, with downregulation of PVALB mRNA observed in specific brain regions (Filice2020ThePH).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), significant downregulation of the PVALB gene in the motor cortex correlates with severe cortical neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Elevated levels of PVALB protein in cerebrospinal fluid have been proposed as a potential biomarker for the disease, reflecting interneuron loss and cortical pathology (Magliozzi2021CSFPL).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of PVALB in various medical conditions, highlighting its role not only in the normal functioning of inhibitory interneurons but also in the pathophysiology of several major disorders.

## Interactions
Parvalbumin (PVALB) interacts with various proteins that influence its role in calcium signaling and neuronal activity. It is known to interact with small conductance (SK) Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, which are crucial for modulating intrinsic oscillations and affecting the excitability and firing patterns of neurons (Filice2020ThePH). Additionally, PVALB is involved in interactions with other essential calcium handling components such as the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pumps and plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs), which are vital for maintaining calcium dynamics and energy metabolism within neurons (Filice2020ThePH). These interactions are significant for the overall calcium signaling and neurotransmitter release in neurons.

Moreover, PVALB is coexpressed with the K V 3.1b channel in cortical Pvalb neurons, which is essential for maintaining the fast-spiking phenotype of these neurons, crucial for proper synaptic transmission and neuronal firing precision (Filice2020ThePH). The interaction of PVALB with these channels and pumps highlights its role in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic function, which are critical in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.
