# DPPA3

## Overview
DPPA3, or Developmental Pluripotency Associated 3, is a gene that encodes the protein developmental pluripotency associated 3, which plays a crucial role in early embryonic development and the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. The protein is primarily involved in regulating DNA methylation patterns essential for the developmental potential and stability of pluripotent factors. DPPA3 is also critical in protecting the maternal genome from active demethylation during early embryogenesis, particularly at genomic imprinted sites, by inhibiting the activity of the Tet3 enzyme. This gene and its protein product are integral to processes such as chromatin condensation and epigenetic modifications, which are vital for normal embryo development. The absence or dysfunction of DPPA3 leads to significant developmental and reproductive issues, highlighting its importance in biological systems and potential implications in clinical contexts (Zhao2022Dppa3; Zhao2018Dppa3).

## Structure
The molecular structure of human DPPA3 (Developmental Pluripotency Associated 3) exhibits unique characteristics when bound to the UHRF1 PHD finger. The protein primarily forms a single long Î±-helix at the position corresponding to both short and long Î±-helices in mouse DPPA3, which form an L-like shape. This structural difference is marked by a proline to lysine substitution at the 95th position in human DPPA3, which does not enhance binding affinity for the UHRF1 PHD finger (Shiraishi2024Structure). Additionally, the C-terminus of the VRT motif in human DPPA3 forms a four-turn single Î±-helix, which is not kinked unlike its mouse counterpart, suggesting a potential for dimerization or an artifact of crystal packing (Shiraishi2024Structure).

In terms of interaction, human DPPA3 binds to the UHRF1 PHD finger through a conserved VRT sequence motif, although with a smaller contact area compared to mouse DPPA3, indicating a weaker binding affinity (Shiraishi2024Structure). The binding mode involves the VRT motif at residues 85-87, interacting through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Shiraishi2024Structure).

Despite these detailed insights into the secondary structure and binding interactions, the available sources do not provide comprehensive information on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of human DPPA3, nor do they mention specific domains, prominent folds, common post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
DPPA3, also known as Stella or PGC7, is a gene that plays a significant role in the molecular processes of early human embryonic development and in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ES cells). The protein encoded by DPPA3 is involved in regulating DNA methylation patterns, which are crucial for the developmental potential and stability of key pluripotent factors such as Nanog and Uhrf1. It inhibits their degradation through the proteasome pathway, thereby safeguarding the self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells (Zhao2022Dppa3).

In the context of human cells, DPPA3 is essential for the protection of the maternal genome from active demethylation, particularly at genomic imprinted sites. This is achieved by inhibiting the activity of the Tet3 enzyme, which is involved in converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), thus maintaining the integrity of the maternal genome during early embryogenesis (Zhao2018Dppa3). Additionally, DPPA3 plays a crucial role in chromatin condensation and epigenetic modifications, which are essential for the normal development of embryos (Zhao2018Dppa3). The absence of DPPA3 leads to developmental issues, such as a decrease in the number of blastocysts, fewer implants, and a reduced yield of viable pups, underscoring its critical function in early developmental stages (Zhao2018Dppa3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPPA3 gene, also known as Stella or PGC7, have been linked to significant reproductive and developmental issues in mice, which may suggest similar implications in humans given the gene's conserved function across species. Specifically, alterations in DPPA3 expression or its normal interactions can lead to developmental abnormalities and fertility issues. For instance, the absence or alteration in the cleavage of DPPA3 leads to problems in vesicular trafficking, negatively impacting pre-implantation development and resulting in decreased female fertility (Shin2017Cytoplasmic). Additionally, mutations like K96A prevent the polyubiquitination of DPPA3, affecting the protein's localization and persistence in the cytoplasm of embryos, which is crucial for its degradation and functional roles in early embryonic development (Shin2017Cytoplasmic).

Furthermore, DPPA3-deficient female mice exhibit infertility, and embryos from such females are arrested before implantation, highlighting the gene's critical function in fertility and embryonic development (Nakashima2013Effects). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of DPPA3 in human reproductive health and embryogenesis, suggesting that disruptions in DPPA3 could be linked to similar reproductive and developmental disorders in humans.

## Interactions
DPPA3 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in regulating DNA methylation and chromatin dynamics. One of its key interactions is with the UHRF1 PHD finger, where specific amino acid sequences and structural motifs of DPPA3, such as the VRT cassette and Î±-helices, engage in complex formation. This interaction inhibits UHRF1's chromatin localization, thereby promoting passive DNA demethylation (Hata2022Structural). Mutations in these interaction interfaces, such as R89A/T90A and L91A/V94A, significantly impair DPPA3's regulatory effects on UHRF1, affecting processes like chromatin recruitment and DNA methylation (Hata2022Structural).

Additionally, DPPA3 interacts with TET proteins, particularly TET3, which are crucial for the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, a key process in DNA methylation regulation. This interaction is vital for maintaining specific methylation patterns during early embryonic development (Bakhtari2014DPPA3). In somatic cells, DPPA3's interaction with TET3 is independent of the methylation status of histone H3 lysine 9, suggesting a targeted regulatory mechanism that does not rely on histone modifications (Wang2019Dimethylated).
