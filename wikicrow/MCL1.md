# MCL1

## Overview
MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) is a gene located on chromosome 1q21 that encodes the MCL1 apoptosis regulator, a member of the BCL-2 family of proteins. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, acting predominantly as an anti-apoptotic factor by inhibiting the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins and promoting cell survival. The MCL1 protein is characterized by its BCL-2 homology domains and a C-terminal transmembrane domain, which anchors it to the mitochondrial outer membrane, crucial for its function in apoptosis regulation (Day2008Structure). The protein's ability to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family through its hydrophobic groove is essential for its role in controlling the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (Senichkin2019Molecular). MCL1's involvement in apoptosis and cell survival mechanisms makes it a significant factor in the development and progression of cancer, where its overexpression is often associated with increased cell viability and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (Moshynska2004Prognostic).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the MCL1 protein, a member of the BCL-2 family, is characterized by its multidomain, all-helical architecture, which is crucial for its role in apoptosis regulation. The protein is composed of nine alpha helices linked by loops, with a significant portion of these helices forming a hydrophobic groove that is essential for binding interactions with proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (Senichkin2019Molecular; Day2008Structure). This binding groove is formed by helices Î±2, Î±3, Î±4, and Î±5, and is a key feature in the tertiary structure of MCL1, facilitating its interaction with other proteins at the quaternary level (Senichkin2019Molecular).

MCL1 is distinguished from other BCL-2 family members by an extended N-terminal region that includes PEST sequences, which are signals for rapid degradation, and a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) (Senichkin2019Molecular). The protein also features a C-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors it to the mitochondrial outer membrane, enhancing its functional interactions with cellular structures (Senichkin2019Molecular).

Additionally, MCL1 exists in several splice variant isoforms, including Mcl-1L, Mcl-1S, and Mcl-1ES, which differ in their pro- and anti-apoptotic functions. These isoforms are generated through alternative splicing, contributing to the functional diversity of the protein in apoptosis regulation (Senichkin2019Molecular). The structural integrity and specific interactions of MCL1 with BH3-only proteins like Noxa and Puma are critical for its regulatory role in apoptosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Day2008Structure).

## Function
MCL1 (MCL1 apoptosis regulator, BCL2 family member) is a gene that encodes a protein playing a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in cells. The MCL1 protein is primarily known for its anti-apocalyptic functions, crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating apoptosis, a process critical for removing damaged or unnecessary cells. It achieves this by interacting with other proteins in the Bcl-2 family to control the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), preventing the release of pro-apoptotic factors like cytochrome c into the cytosol, thereby inhibiting the apoptosis cascade (Widden2021The).

Beyond its role in apoptosis, MCL1 is involved in various other cellular functions including cell proliferation, DNA damage response, autophagy, calcium handling, and mitochondrial quality control. These activities are essential for normal cell function and survival, indicating that MCL1's role extends beyond just preventing apoptosis. It is also implicated in cellular differentiation and the maintenance of healthy tissues, particularly evident in its requirement for the survival and differentiation of specific cell lineages during embryonic development (Widden2021The).

## Clinical Significance
MCL1, a gene encoding an antiapoptotic protein of the BCL-2 family, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating apoptosis. Alterations in MCL1 expression or mutations are associated with several hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Overexpression of MCL1 is frequently observed in cancers such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and various solid tumors including breast and non-small cell lung cancer. This overexpression is often linked to poor prognosis and resistance to anticancer drugs (Xiang2018MCL-1; Tantawy2023Targeting; Moshynska2004Prognostic).

In CLL, specific mutations such as insertions in the MCL1 promoter have been identified, correlating with higher protein expression, rapid disease progression, and shorter survival rates. These genetic alterations significantly impact the prognosis and treatment responses in CLL patients (Moshynska2004Prognostic).

Furthermore, resistance to targeted therapies like venetoclax in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been mediated through MCL1 upregulation, highlighting its role in chemotherapeutic resistance (Tantawy2023Targeting). The gene's amplification and the resultant protein overexpression contribute to the evasion of apoptosis, facilitating tumor growth and survival, underscoring the clinical significance of targeting MCL1 in cancer therapy (Wang2021Targeting).

## Interactions
MCL1, a member of the BCL-2 family, interacts with several proteins, influencing apoptosis and cell survival. It forms a complex with Puma, a p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis, where the BH1 domain of MCL1 and the BH3 domain of Puma are crucial for their interaction. This interaction is significant for the localization and function of MCL1 in apoptosis regulation (Mei2005Puma*Mcl-1).

Additionally, MCL1 interacts with fortilin, a protein identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction, specific to the C-terminal 168 amino acids of fortilin, was confirmed through various assays, including co-immunoprecipitation in COS-7 cells. Fortilin interacts exclusively with MCL1 among tested Bcl-2 family proteins, highlighting a unique interaction pathway that contributes to the anti-apocalyptic properties of both proteins (Zhang2002Physical).

MCL1 also interacts with Cdk1 through a specific truncated form called snMcl-1, primarily localized in the nucleus. This interaction, which occurs independently of Cdk1's usual cyclin partners, results in reduced kinase activity of Cdk1, suggesting that snMcl-1 acts as an inhibitor of Cdk1 activity, thereby regulating cell growth (JAMIL2005A).

These interactions underline the multifaceted role of MCL1 in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle, crucial for understanding its function in cellular processes and disease states.
