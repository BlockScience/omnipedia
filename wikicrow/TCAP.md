# TCAP

## Overview
The human gene TCAP encodes the protein titin-cap, commonly referred to as telethonin, which is integral to muscle structure and function. Telethonin is a small, non-enzymatic protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and stability of sarcomeres, the fundamental units of muscle fibers. It is specifically localized to the Z-discs within sarcomeres where it binds to titin, a major filamentous protein, to maintain the structural integrity of muscle cells. This interaction is essential for proper muscle function, including contraction and elasticity. Mutations in the TCAP gene are associated with various muscular dystrophies, highlighting its importance in muscle health and disease (Zhang2011Transcriptional; Gregorio1998The). Telethonin's role extends beyond structural support, as it is also involved in signaling pathways that regulate muscle growth and repair (Zhang2011Transcriptional).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the human TCAP (titin-cap) protein, also known as telethonin, is characterized by its interaction with the titin protein at the Z-disk of sarcomeres in muscle cells. Telethonin is a small protein, consisting of 167 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 18.96 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.38 (Qiao2014Molecular). It contains a conserved Telethonin superfamily domain, which is common across mammalian species, suggesting a conserved structural role in muscle function (Qiao2014Molecular).

Telethonin interacts specifically with the Z1 and Z2 immunoglobulin-like domains of titin through its N-terminal region, which comprises the first 53 residues (Qiao2014Molecular). This interaction is crucial for the antiparallel assembly of two Z1Z2 domains, forming a 2:1 titin/telethonin complex that is essential for myofibril assembly and the maintenance of the intact Z-disk in skeletal and cardiac muscles (Qiao2014Molecular). The C-terminus of telethonin is involved in the dimerization of this complex, further stabilizing the structure (Qiao2014Molecular).

While specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature, the described interactions and domain information highlight the functional architecture of telethonin in muscle tissue integrity and mechanics.

## Function
The human gene TCAP encodes the protein titin-cap, also known as telethonin, which is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. This protein plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of sarcomeres, the basic units of muscle fibers responsible for muscle contraction. TCAP specifically associates with the Z-discs of sarcomeres, where it interacts with titin, a major structural protein that spans the length of the sarcomere. This interaction is essential for maintaining the proper alignment and function of the sarcomeric proteins, which is critical for muscle contraction and overall muscle function (Zhang2011Transcriptional).

TCAP is involved in the assembly and maintenance of the myofibril structure in muscle cells. It is targeted specifically to the Z-line of the sarcomere, not the A band, highlighting its specific functional role in this region. The interaction between TCAP and titin at the Z-discs is vital for the organization and structural continuity of the sarcomere, contributing to the overall mechanical properties of muscle tissues (Gregorio1998The).

Mutations in the TCAP gene, which encodes the Tcap protein, are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G (LGMD2G), a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness. This highlights the importance of Tcap in muscle health and disease (Zhang2011Transcriptional). Additionally, TCAP is involved in the regulation of myostatin, a protein that inhibits muscle growth, suggesting a role in muscle development and regeneration (Zhang2011Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCAP gene, which encodes the protein telethonin, are implicated in several muscular and cardiac disorders. In the context of muscular dystrophies, TCAP mutations are primarily associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G (LGMD2G). This condition is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, particularly affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. Specific mutations, such as a TGG-to-TGA substitution at codon 25 and a 157CâT transition, lead to premature stop codons and truncated telethonin proteins, severely impacting muscle function (OlivÃ©2008Transcription-terminating; Moreira2000Limb-girdle).

In the realm of cardiac health, TCAP mutations have been linked to both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). These mutations affect the protein's interaction with other critical proteins in the Z-disc of sarcomeres, such as titin and muscle LIM protein (MLP), which are essential for the structural integrity and function of heart muscle. For instance, mutations like T137I and R153H enhance interactions in HCM, while mutations like E132Q impair interactions in DCM, influencing the clinical manifestations of these cardiomyopathies (Hayashi2004Tcap).

These findings underscore the critical role of TCAP in maintaining the structural integrity and proper function of muscle cells, with mutations leading to significant clinical consequences in both skeletal and cardiac muscles.

## Interactions
TCAP, encoded by the titin-cap gene, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for cellular functions and physiological processes. One of the primary interactions of TCAP is with latrophilins (LPHNs), particularly LPHN1, where it acts as an endogenous ligand. This interaction is significant in synaptic function and behavior, influencing synaptic circuits and behaviors related to stress and emotionality (Woelfle2015Ancient). TCAP-1, a specific peptide region of teneurin-1, directly associates with the Hormone Binding Domain (HBD) of LPHN1, modulating cell-to-cell adhesion and affecting cytoskeletal dynamics (HusiÄ2019Teneurin). This interaction also involves the GAIN domain of LPHN1, which may contribute to the peptide-binding pocket, influencing downstream signaling effects crucial for cellular adhesion and cytoskeletal changes (HusiÄ2019Teneurin).

Additionally, TCAP is part of a trans-synaptic complex that includes other proteins like dystroglycan and neurexins, which are essential for synaptic stability (Woelfle2015Ancient). The interaction between TCAP and dystroglycans is particularly noted for its role in synaptic plasticity, facilitated by the activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway (Woelfle2015Ancient). These interactions underscore the multifunctional role of TCAP in neural and synaptic regulation.
