# OPN4

## Overview
The OPN4 gene encodes the protein opsin 4, also known as melanopsin, which is a member of the opsin superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This protein plays a crucial role in various light-dependent physiological processes, including circadian rhythm regulation and pupillary light reflex. Opsin 4 is primarily expressed in the retina's photosensitive ganglion cells and is also found in other tissues such as the skin. The gene produces two isoforms through alternative splicing, which differ in their C-terminal regions, potentially leading to different functional outcomes in light signal transduction. The protein's structure features seven transmembrane domains typical of GPCRs, facilitating its role in phototransduction by interacting with specific G protein subunits. This interaction is essential for the conversion of light signals into cellular responses, influencing a range of biological processes from sleep patterns to skin protection against ultraviolet radiation (Hughes2014Using; Pires2009Differential).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the OPN4 protein, also known as melanopsin, is characterized by several key features typical of the opsin superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These include seven alpha-helical transmembrane regions that form a bundle within the membrane, creating a hollow cavity on the extracellular side that serves as a binding site for the chromophore, retinal (Pires2009Differential). Specific amino acids within these regions play critical roles in the protein's function, such as lysine at position 337, which forms a Schiff's base, and tyrosine at position 145, potentially acting as a counterion. Additionally, a DRY tripeptide located at positions 166-168 is involved in transducin binding, essential for the protein's signaling function (Pires2009Differential).

The OPN4 gene generates two isoforms, Opn4L and Opn4S, through alternate splicing. These isoforms are identical for the first 454 amino acids but differ in the length of their C-terminal tails, with Opn4L being 521 amino acids in total and Opn4S being 466 amino acids. The differences in the C-terminal motifs of the two isoforms may influence their coupling to distinct transduction cascades within the native cell environment (Pires2009Differential).

## Function
OPN4, also known as melanopsin, is a photopigment gene expressed in various human tissues, including the skin and the eyes. In the retina, OPN4 is primarily involved in non-image-forming visual functions such as circadian rhythm regulation and pupillary light reflex. It responds to specific wavelengths of light, particularly blue light, and plays a crucial role in conveying light information to the brain, influencing physiological processes like sleep and hormone regulation.

In human skin, OPN4 is expressed in cells such as keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts. It mediates light-induced intracellular signaling pathways, notably through the Gq protein-coupled receptor (GqPCR) signaling pathway. This pathway activates phospholipase C, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium levels upon exposure to light, which is essential for converting light signals into cellular responses. OPN4 also triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, influencing cellular functions such as growth and differentiation by phosphorylating extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) (Kusumoto2020OPN4).

Furthermore, OPN4 has been shown to play a significant role in the skin's response to UVA radiation, contributing to protective pigmentation by mediating increases in melanin content upon UVA exposure (de2018Melanopsin). This suggests that OPN4 not only functions in light perception but also in protective responses against ultraviolet radiation, highlighting its broader role in human cell biology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OPN4 gene, which encodes the light-sensitive protein melanopsin, have been linked to various physiological and behavioral responses to light, impacting conditions such as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and sleep disturbances. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OPN4, like Pro10Leu and Thr394Ile, have been associated with abnormal non-image-forming (NIF) responses, including altered sleep onset times and attenuated pupillary light responses. These mutations potentially disrupt melanopsin's function, influencing circadian photoentrainment and other light-dependent behaviors (Rodgers2018Defining).

In the context of cutaneous melanoma, a type of skin cancer, OPN4 has been identified as an oncogene. Studies have shown that the absence of OPN4 leads to slower tumor growth and progression, suggesting that its expression promotes melanoma cell proliferation and aggressiveness. This oncogenic role highlights the potential of targeting OPN4 in therapeutic strategies for melanoma (de2022Melanopsin).

Overall, the clinical significance of OPN4 spans from its involvement in mood and sleep regulation disorders to its role in cancer progression, underscoring the diverse implications of its function and regulation in human health.

## Interactions
OPN4, also known as melanopsin, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that interacts with various G protein subunits to mediate phototransduction in photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). Specifically, OPN4 has been shown to couple with the Gnaq, Gna11, and Gna14 G protein subunits. These interactions are essential for the melanopsin phototransduction pathway, which is distinct from the pathways used by traditional rod and cone photoreceptors and resembles an invertebrate-like phototransduction mechanism (Hughes2014Using). 

In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that silencing of these G protein subunits using siRNA techniques significantly impacts the light response in cells, indicating that Gnaq, Gna11, and Gna14 are necessary for complete melanopsin function (Hughes2014Using). Additionally, the expression of Gna14 can partially rescue the melanopsin response when Gnaq and Gna11 are both silenced, suggesting that Gna14 can also couple with melanopsin to mediate signaling (Hughes2014Using).

These interactions contribute to the diversity of light responses mediated by different subtypes of pRGCs, as the specific interactions between melanopsin and these G proteins might vary between different cell types (Hughes2014Using).
