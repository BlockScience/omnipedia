# SBK3

## Overview
SBK3, or SH3 domain binding kinase family member 3, is a gene that encodes the protein SH3 domain binding kinase family member 3. This protein is a kinase, which means it functions by adding phosphate groups to other proteins, thereby modulating their activity. SBK3 specifically interacts with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a known mediator of protein-protein interactions, which suggests its involvement in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell proliferation, and cytoskeletal modifications. The protein is particularly noted for its expression in human skeletal muscle and its potential implications in muscle physiology and diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Despite its significant roles, SBK3 is classified as a 'dark kinase' due to the limited research and understanding of its functions, which highlights the need for further investigation, especially in the context of its potential therapeutic relevance in cancer and other diseases (Nieves-Rodriguez2023Transcriptomic; Ahn2020Integrative; Essegian2020The).

## Function
SBK3 (SH3 domain binding kinase family member 3) is a kinase that interacts with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which plays a crucial role in various cellular functions including cell proliferation, cytoskeletal modifications, and signal transduction (Ahn2020Integrative). Although the specific molecular functions of SBK3 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature, its association with the SH3 domain suggests involvement in signaling pathways that regulate cellular architecture and communication. SBK3 has been identified as differentially expressed in healthy human skeletal muscle, indicating its potential role in muscle physiology or in response to muscular diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (Nieves-Rodriguez2023Transcriptomic). Additionally, SBK3 is categorized as a 'dark kinase' due to limited research data and poorly defined biological roles, but it has been noted for potential interactions with FDA-approved multi-kinase inhibitors, suggesting its involvement in significant biological processes that could impact cancer phenotypes when inhibited (Essegian2020The). This highlights the potential clinical relevance of SBK3 in therapeutic contexts, particularly in oncology, despite the current gaps in detailed functional understanding.

## Interactions
SBK3 (SH3 domain binding kinase family member 3) is a protein that interacts with other proteins through its SH3 domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions. This suggests that SBK3 may be involved in various cellular functions such as cell proliferation, cytoskeletal modifications, and signal transduction. However, specific pathways and interactions related to SBK3 in the atrial appendage or other heart tissues have not been fully identified or documented in the provided studies. The roles of these kinases, including SBK3, in the heart and their specific protein and nucleic acid interactions remain to be investigated (Ahn2020Integrative). Additionally, while SBK3 is categorized as an 'unreported gene' with no existing documentation on its related diseases and functions in the heart in humans, its exclusive expression in the atrial appendage suggests a potentially significant role in heart-specific biological processes (Ahn2020Integrative). Further research is necessary to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of SBK3's interactions and its implications in cardiac function and pathology.
