# KCNK2

## Overview
KCNK2 is a gene located in the human genome that encodes the protein known as potassium two pore domain channel subfamily K member 2 (TREK-1). This protein is a member of the two-pore-domain potassium channel (K2P) family, characterized by its unique structure that includes four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains. Unlike many other potassium channels, TREK-1 does not require voltage to activate, making it fundamentally important in setting the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. The protein is sensitive to a variety of physical and chemical stimuli, which allows it to play a critical role in neuroprotection, pain perception, and cardiac function. Due to its significant functions in various physiological processes and disease conditions, KCNK2 and its encoded protein TREK-1 are considered potential targets for therapeutic interventions in a range of disorders, including depression, epilepsy, and cardiac arrhythmias (Bockenhauer2001KCNK2:; Nasr2018Identification; Kim2005Physiology).

## Structure
The human KCNK2 gene encodes the TREK-1 protein, which is part of the two-pore-domain potassium channel (K2P) family. The TREK-1 protein is characterized by a 2P/4TM topology, consisting of four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains. This structural configuration is distinct from the more typical voltage-gated potassium channels, which generally feature one pore domain and six transmembrane segments (Bockenhauer2001KCNK2:).

A key feature of the KCNK2 protein is its sensitivity to phosphorylation at serine 348, a canonical site for protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylation at this site can reversibly switch the channel from a voltage-insensitive to a voltage-dependent state, significantly altering its functional phenotype (Bockenhauer2001KCNK2:; Goldstein2001Potassium). This post-translational modification underscores the dynamic regulatory mechanisms that influence the function of KCNK2 channels.

However, the available sources do not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the KCNK2 protein, nor do they mention specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms. Therefore, a comprehensive description of these aspects of the KCNK2 protein structure cannot be provided based on the current context.

## Function
KCNK2, also known as TREK-1, encodes a two-pore domain potassium channel that is crucial in setting the resting membrane potential and regulating cell excitability. This channel is activated by various physical and chemical stimuli, including lipids, volatile anesthetics, heat, oxygen, protons, and membrane tension (Kim2005Physiology). TREK-1, a specific protein encoded by KCNK2, is sensitive to mechanical stimuli such as membrane stretch, intracellular pH changes, and temperature, which allows it to respond adaptively to a range of physiological conditions (Kim2005Physiology).

In healthy human cells, KCNK2 plays a significant role in neuroprotection and the modulation of cardiac action potentials. It contributes to maintaining cellular membrane resting potentials, which is essential for the normal function of neurons and cardiac myocytes (Nasr2018Identification). The channel's activity can be modulated by G protein-coupled receptors through phosphorylation processes, indicating its involvement in neurotransmitter and peptide hormone-mediated signal transduction (Kim2005Physiology).

Overall, KCNK2's function in cellular and organismal physiology includes modulation of pain perception, protection against ischemia, and regulation of mood, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in conditions like depression, pain, epilepsy, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias (Nasr2018Identification).

## Clinical Significance
KCNK2, also known as TREK-1, has been implicated in a variety of diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the cardiovascular system, changes in KCNK2 expression are linked to serious conditions such as atrial fibrillation, which can occur following cardiac remodeling with decreased KCNK2 expression, and pathological ventricular hypertrophy associated with increased expression (Nasr2018Identification). Additionally, mutations affecting KCNK2 and its regulatory genes, like POPDC1, can lead to atrio-ventricular block, underscoring its critical role in cardiac electrophysiology (Nasr2018Identification).

In the central nervous system, KCNK2 has been associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders. For instance, knockout mice lacking functional KCNK2 exhibit resistance to depression and increased sensitivity to epilepsy and stroke (Nasr2018Identification). Moreover, KCNK2 has been identified as a pharmacological target for depression, with inhibitors like Spadin showing therapeutic effects in mouse models (Nasr2018Identification).

KCNK2's role extends to cancer biology, where its expression levels vary significantly across different types. It is underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, correlating with poor overall survival, and overexpressed in prostate and epithelial ovarian cancer (Li2019KCNK). In papillary thyroid carcinoma, KCNK2 expression is negatively associated with the infiltration of certain immune cells, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment and potential impact on tumor immunity and progression (Lin2020The).

## Interactions
KCNK2, also known as TREK-1, is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, which are crucial for its function and regulation. The protein interacts with riluzole, which can activate or inhibit KCNK2 through direct interaction or mediated by PKA phosphorylation (Nasr2018Identification). Additionally, KCNK2's expression is regulated by POPEYE domain proteins in cardiac tissues, which impacts cardiac function and conditions like atrio-ventricular block (Nasr2018Identification). 

In the context of thyroid carcinoma, KCNK2 is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes interactions with other potassium channels from the KCNN and KCNQ families and protein kinase CAMP-activated catalytic units (PRKACA, PRKACB, PRKACG) (Lin2020The). Furthermore, KCNK2 has been shown to interact with various kinase targets, miRNA-targets, and transcription factor-target interactions in thyroid carcinoma, which includes PDGFRB, MIR-221, MIR-222, MIR-144, MIR-500, and MIR-34B, as well as transcription factors like CAGNYGKNAAA_UNKNOWN and YGTCCTTGR_UNKNOWN (Lin2020The).

These interactions suggest that KCNK2 is involved in complex regulatory networks that influence its role in cellular excitability and response to physiological stimuli, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in various diseases.
