# PPP2R1A

## Overview
PPP2R1A is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 2 scaffold subunit Aalpha, a critical component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex. This protein serves as a regulatory subunit within the PP2A holoenzyme, a major serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the negative control of cell growth and division. The PPP2R1A gene plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional integrity of the PP2A complex, facilitating the assembly of the core enzyme with its regulatory subunits, which is essential for its activity in various cellular processes. Mutations in PPP2R1A have been associated with several human diseases, including cancers and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling (Reynhout2019Physiologic; JANSSENS2001Protein).

## Structure
The PPP2R1A protein, also known as the scaffolding AÎ± subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), exhibits a complex molecular structure that is crucial for its function within the PP2A holoenzyme. The protein is primarily composed of 15 tandem repeats of a 39-amino-acid sequence known as the HEAT motif, each consisting of two Î±-helices connected by intra-repeat loops. This arrangement forms an elongated, asymmetrical structure resembling a hook or C-shape, which is essential for its interaction with other subunits of the PP2A complex (Verbinnen2021Protein; JANSSENS2001Protein).

The secondary structure of PPP2R1A is predominantly Î±-helical, contributing to the overall stability and functionality of the protein. These helices and loops facilitate the binding of regulatory B subunits and the catalytic C subunit, crucial for the assembly and enzymatic activity of the PP2A holoenzyme (Qian2023Novel; Verbinnen2021Protein).

Specific domains within the PPP2R1A protein, such as the intra-helical repeat loops labeled HR4, HR5, HR6, and HR7, are particularly significant for binding different regulatory B subunits, indicating a modular interaction domain that contributes to the specificity and regulation of the PP2A complex (Verbinnen2021Protein).

## Function
PPP2R1A encodes the structural A subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, a critical regulator of various cellular processes. This gene plays a fundamental role in the assembly and function of PP2A holoenzymes, which are involved in dephosphorylating serine/threonine residues on various substrates, influencing numerous signaling pathways crucial for processes such as cell proliferation, cell death, cell division, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and metabolism (Sents2012The; Haesen2014The). 

The A subunit encoded by PPP2R1A is essential for the stability and proper assembly of the PP2A complex. It binds both the catalytic C subunit and various regulatory B-type subunits, forming a trimeric holoenzyme. This assembly is crucial for the enzyme's activity and specificity, as the regulatory B-type subunits determine the substrate specificity, regulation, and subcellular localization of the PP2A holoenzymes (Reynhout2019Physiologic; Verbinnen2021Protein). 

Moreover, PPP2R1A is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly the G2/M transition, by maintaining the M-phase-promoting factor (MPF) in its inactive precursor form, thus controlling the entry into mitosis (JANSSENS2001Protein). Dysregulation of PP2A, involving mutations in PPP2R1A, has been linked to various diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its pivotal role in cell regulation and organismal health (Verbinnen2021Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP2R1A gene, which encodes the scaffold subunit Aalpha of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), are implicated in a range of diseases, primarily characterized by their impact on neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers. In neurodevelopmental contexts, mutations such as P179L, R182W, and R258H are associated with severe intellectual disability, absent speech, and brain malformations including agenesis of the corpus callosum (Houge2015B56Î´-related; Lenaerts2021The). These mutations disrupt the binding dynamics within the PP2A complex, leading to altered phosphorylation and loss of function, which are critical in brain development and function.

In cancer, PPP2R1A mutations are notably prevalent in endometrial carcinomas, including uterine serous carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma. Mutations such as P179R and S256F are linked to advanced disease stages and poor survival, often occurring alongside genomic features like high copy-number alterations and mutations in other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (Taylor2019The). These mutations impair the tumor suppressive functions of PP2A, promoting tumorigenesis through destabilization of the PP2A holoenzyme complex and enhanced degradation of its subunits (Taylor2019The).

Overall, the clinical significance of PPP2R1A mutations underscores their role in both developmental and oncogenic pathways, highlighting the gene's critical function in regulating cell growth and signaling processes.

## Interactions
PPP2R1A, the scaffold subunit of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), engages in several critical protein-protein interactions that influence its function and regulatory roles within the cell. Notably, PPP2R1A interacts with RAB8 and RAB9, members of the RAB family of proteins. These interactions occur independently of GTP and negatively affect the assembly of the PP2A holoenzyme, leading to its inactivation, which is significant in controlling the tumor suppressor activity of PP2A in specific subcellular compartments (Sacco2016A). Additionally, PPP2R1A's interaction with RAB9 competes with its interaction with the PP2A catalytic subunit (PPP2CA), suggesting a competitive binding scenario that impacts the formation and function of the PP2A complex (Sacco2016A).

Mutations in PPP2R1A can significantly alter its interaction capabilities. Specific mutations, such as Met180Thr, Asp282Argfs*14, Val470Ala, and Arg498Leu, affect PPP2R1A's binding with other proteins like PPP2R5D and PPP2CA, which could potentially alter its functional role in cellular processes (Qian2023Novel). Furthermore, mutations like P179L, R182W, and R258H impact PPP2R1A's ability to bind with various PP2A subunits, influencing the assembly and function of the PP2A holoenzyme and leading to potential dominant-negative effects on specific subunits like B56Î´ (Houge2015B56Î´-related). These interactions and the effects of mutations underscore the critical role of PPP2R1A in cellular regulation and the potential consequences of its dysfunction.
