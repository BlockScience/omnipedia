# CD1D

## Overview
The CD1D gene, located on chromosome 1 in humans, encodes the CD1d protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is structurally and functionally related to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. CD1d is a member of the CD1 family of glycoproteins, which are involved in the presentation of lipid and glycolipid antigens to immune cells, particularly natural killer T (NKT) cells. This interaction plays a crucial role in the modulation of immune responses, including the initiation and regulation of immunity against pathogens and in autoimmunity. The CD1d molecule itself is characterized by a heavy chain that is non-covalently associated with beta-2-microglobulin and contains a deep hydrophobic antigen-binding groove that accommodates lipid antigens (Joyce2001CD1d; Borg2007Structural). The gene and its protein product are significant not only in the context of immune function but also in clinical scenarios where alterations in CD1d expression and function are linked to disease states such as cancer and autoimmune disorders (Bojarska-Junak2014CD1d).

## Structure
The CD1D gene encodes the CD1d protein, which is structurally related to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The CD1d protein consists of a heavy chain that is non-covalently associated with beta-2-microglobulin (Î²2m). The heavy chain includes three extracellular domains: Î±1, Î±2, and Î±3. The Î±1 and Î±2 domains form a deep cleft that serves as the antigen-binding site, characterized by a hydrophobic binding groove formed by two alpha helices flanking the opening and a beta sheet forming the floor (Joyce2001CD1d; Borg2007Structural). This groove is notably larger and more hydrophobic compared to those in MHC class I molecules, accommodating a diverse range of lipid antigens (Zeng1997Crystal; Borg2007Structural).

The Î±3 domain, along with Î²2m, achieves an immunoglobulin-like fold and interacts extensively with the underside of the beta sheet floor of the Î±1Î±2 superdomain, contributing to the stability of the molecule (Joyce2001CD1d). The structure of CD1d also includes specific pockets within the binding groove, known as the A' and F' pockets, which are ideally suited for binding lipid antigens (Rossjohn2012Recognition).

Post-translational modifications of the CD1d protein include the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides, which are crucial for the proper folding and function of the molecule (Joyce2001CD1d). Additionally, alternative splicing of the CD1D gene results in multiple isoforms, which may vary in their molecular structure and function, particularly in the presence or absence of certain domains (Kojo2000Alternative). These variations can influence the stability and functional capabilities of CD1d molecules on the cell surface.

## Function
The CD1D gene encodes the CD1d protein, a member of the CD1 family of glycoproteins that are structurally related to MHC class I and class II molecules. CD1d is involved in the presentation of lipid and glycolipid antigens to a subset of T cells known as natural killer T (NKT) cells, playing a crucial role in the immune system by facilitating the activation of these cells (Porcelli1999THE; Joyce2001CD1d). The protein has a deep hydrophobic cleft that binds the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains of glycolipids, positioning their hydrophilic head groups for interaction with the T-cell receptor on NKT cells. This interaction is essential for the specificity of immune responses mediated by NKT cells, as they can discriminate between different sugar moieties attached to the lipid (Joyce2001CD1d).

CD1d is expressed on various cell types including antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells and macrophages, as well as non-hematopoietic cells such as epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. This widespread expression suggests a significant role in immune surveillance and response across different tissues (chaudhry2014role). The protein functions by internalizing and trafficking from the cell surface to endosomal and lysosomal compartments where it exchanges its ligands with glycolipids before returning to the cell surface to present these lipids to NKT cells (Spada2000Low). This process is vital for the early immune events that lead to a robust and effective immune defense against pathogens (Joyce2001CD1d).

## Clinical Significance
CD1D gene mutations and alterations in its expression have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CD1d expression is generally lower compared to healthy individuals, but higher expression levels are associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease progression (Lang2017CD1d-dependent; Bojarska-Junak2014CD1d). Similarly, in multiple myeloma (MM), CD1d is highly expressed in early stages but is significantly reduced as the disease progresses, aiding malignant cells in evading immune surveillance (Papoutselis2020Navigating). This dynamic regulation of CD1d suggests its potential as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in these malignancies (chaudhry2014role).

In autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), altered CD1d expression on B cells correlates with reduced iNKT cell frequency and altered cytokine production, impacting immune balance (chaudhry2014role). Additionally, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infections show a strategic downregulation of CD1d on infected B cells to evade immune detection, which can be counteracted by specific treatments that restore CD1d expression (chaudhry2014role).

These findings underscore the importance of CD1d in the pathogenesis and progression of both hematological cancers and autoimmune conditions, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting CD1d interactions in these diseases.

## Interactions
The CD1d protein, encoded by the CD1D gene, is involved in significant interactions with the Natural Killer T Cell Receptor (NKT TCR), which are crucial for the immune response mechanism. The NKT TCR recognizes lipid antigens presented by CD1d, a process that is essential for the activation of NKT cells. This interaction is characterized by the docking of the NKT TCR onto CD1d in a parallel, tilted mode directly above the F0-pocket of CD1d, where specific residues of CD1d, such as V72 and S76, interact with the Va14 chain of the NKT TCR (Mallevaey2011A). Additionally, the CDR3b loop of the NKT TCR, containing hydrophobic leucine residues, forms a hydrophobic cap that shields a hydrophobic patch on CD1d, playing a critical role in the autoreactivity of the NKT TCR to CD1d (Mallevaey2011A).

Furthermore, CD1d interacts with various glycolipids, such as Î±-galactosylceramide (Î±GalCer), where the acyl and phytosphingosine chains of Î±GalCer are accommodated within the A' and F' pockets of CD1d, respectively. This positioning allows the Î±-galactosyl head group of Î±GalCer to protrude for interaction with the NKT TCR, a key factor in the recognition and response of NKT cells to antigens presented by CD1d (Rossjohn2012Recognition).

These interactions highlight the role of CD1d in the immune system, particularly in the presentation of lipid antigens to NKT cells, facilitating a targeted immune response.
