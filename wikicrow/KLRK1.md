# KLRK1

## Overview
The KLRK1 gene encodes the protein killer cell lectin-like receptor K1 (KLRK1), which is a type II transmembrane receptor belonging to the C-type lectin superfamily. This protein, also known as NKG2D, plays a crucial role in the immune system by functioning as an activating receptor on various immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and certain Î³Î´ T cells. KLRK1/NKG2D recognizes stress-induced ligands that are typically not found on healthy cells, thereby contributing to immune surveillance against infected or transformed cells. The receptor operates by forming a homodimeric structure and interacts with adaptor proteins to transduce signals that activate immune responses, crucial for controlling infections and tumor surveillance (Lanier2015NKG2D; Zafirova2011Regulation). The gene and its encoded protein are significant in the context of disease resistance, immune regulation, and potential therapeutic targets in cancer and other diseases where immune system modulation is beneficial (Zhang2022KLRK1).

## Structure
The KLRK1 protein, also known as NKG2D, is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) crucial for its function. This domain is a Ca2+-binding lectin-like structure, which plays a significant role in the protein's ability to recognize ligands on target cells (Gupta2012NKG2D). NKG2D exists as a homodimer, meaning its quaternary structure involves two identical subunits (Gupta2012NKG2D). 

In terms of isoforms, alternative DNA splicing in mice generates two variants of NKG2D, differing in the length of their cytoplasmic domains: NKG2D-S (short) and NKG2D-L (long). These isoforms associate differentially with the signaling adaptor molecules DAP10 and DAP12, influencing their signaling capabilities (Lanier2015NKG2D; Gupta2012NKG2D). The cytoplasmic tail of DAP10, associated with NKG2D, carries a YxxM motif, which is important for recruiting signaling molecules like the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Grb2 (Gupta2012NKG2D).

The interaction between NKG2D and its adapters involves charged residues within their transmembrane regions, which are crucial for the stability and function of the receptor complex (Lanier2015NKG2D). Each NKG2D homodimer pairs with two DAP10 homodimers to form a hexameric receptor complex, suggesting a complex signaling interaction potential (Gupta2012NKG2D).

## Function
The KLRK1 gene encodes the NKG2D receptor, a C-type lectin-like molecule that functions as an activating receptor on various immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and subsets of Î³Î´ T cells. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the immune surveillance of both infected and transformed cells by recognizing stress-induced ligands that are typically absent from healthy tissues (Lanier2015NKG2D; Zafirova2011Regulation).

NKG2D functions by forming a homodimeric protein structure and is unique among the NKG2 family of receptors in that it lacks any inhibitory isoforms, allowing it to potentially override signals from inhibitory receptors (Zhang2022KLRK1; Antoun2012The). The receptor is involved in the activation of NK cells, leading to target cell killing and cytokine secretion, particularly interferon gamma (IFNG), which plays a role in immune response modulation and cellular signaling pathways (Abrahams2010Faculty).

The interaction between NKG2D and its ligands triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity and co-stimulates cytokine production through a DAP10-phosphoinositol 3-kinase dependent pathway, crucial for the elimination of tumor cells and cells infected with pathogens (von2020MICA). Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the KLRK1 gene can affect the sensitivity of the gene to microRNAs that regulate NKG2D expression, influencing the activity of NK cells and potentially impacting the prevalence of cancers originating from epithelial cells (von2020MICA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the KLRK1 gene, which encodes the NKG2D receptor, have significant implications for various diseases and conditions. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polymorphisms such as those in the NKG2D gene are associated with differential responses to dasatinib treatment, suggesting a role in predicting treatment-free remission (Hara2017NKG2D). Similarly, specific KLRK1 polymorphisms are linked to disease susceptibility and severity in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS), where they affect the responsiveness to TNF inhibitors and the pathogenesis of the disease (Wei2023The).

In cancer, the expression level of KLRK1 is a critical factor in the immune system's ability to combat tumor cells. Downregulation of KLRK1 in tumor tissues, as observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlates with poorer prognosis due to reduced cytotoxic activity of NK cells in the tumor microenvironment (Wang2021Carbon). Additionally, genetic variants of KLRK1 influence cancer risk and progression, with certain alleles linked to increased or decreased risk of various cancers (Siemaszko2021NKG2D).

Furthermore, alterations in the interaction of NKG2D with its ligands, such as the shedding of soluble forms by tumors, contribute to immune evasion, impacting cancer prognosis and treatment outcomes (Groh2002Tumour-derived). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KLRK1 in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of multiple diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
KLRK1, also known as NKG2D, is a receptor that forms a homodimeric structure and interacts with various adaptor molecules for signal transduction. In humans, KLRK1 associates with the hematopoietic cell signal transducer (HCST), also known as DAP10. This interaction is crucial for the cell surface expression of KLRK1 and mediates its signaling functions (Abrahams2010Faculty). The transmembrane region of KLRK1 contains a positively charged arginine residue that pairs with conserved aspartic acid residues in the transmembrane regions of DAP10, facilitating this association (Burgess2007The).

Upon ligand binding, KLRK1 activates the DAP10 receptor complex, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation within the YxxM motif by src family tyrosine kinases. This phosphorylation enables the binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K and the Grb2 adaptor protein to phosphorylated DAP10, further activating the PI3K pathway and downstream signaling events involving proteins such as Akt, MEK, and ERK (Burgess2007The).

KLRK1 also interacts with a variety of ligands, including MICA, MICB, ULBP1-6, and MULT1, which are stress-inducible proteins expressed on the cell surface in response to various forms of cellular stress like DNA damage, infection, and heat shock. These interactions are key to the immune response against cells under stress, potentially leading to the killing of these cells (Eagle2007Promiscuity).
