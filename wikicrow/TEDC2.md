# TEDC2

## Overview
TEDC2, or Tubulin Epsilon and Delta Complex 2, is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin epsilon and delta complex 2, which plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional integrity of centrioles within human cells. The protein is essential for the formation and stabilization of triplet microtubules in centrioles, crucial for maintaining the architecture of these cellular structures and ensuring proper cell division. TEDC2 is part of a protein complex that includes TEDC1, delta-tubulin (TUBD1), and epsilon-tubulin (TUBE1), which are necessary for the correct localization and function of these proteins at the centrosome, particularly at procentrioles and the proximal ends of parental centrioles. Disruptions in TEDC2 expression or function can lead to significant defects in centriole architecture, impacting cell division and stability, and have been implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and the immune microenvironment (Fang2023TEDC2; Pudlowski2024A).

## Function
TEDC2, or Tubulin Epsilon and Delta Complex 2, is a crucial component in the structural integrity and function of centrioles in human cells. The protein encoded by the TEDC2 gene is integral to the formation and stabilization of triplet microtubules within centrioles, which are essential for maintaining the unique architecture of these cellular structures. TEDC2 operates within a protein complex alongside TEDC1, delta-tubulin (TUBD1), and epsilon-tubulin (TUBE1), which is necessary for the proper localization and mutual function of these proteins at the centrosome, particularly at procentrioles and the proximal ends of parental centrioles (Pudlowski2024A).

The loss of TEDC2 leads to significant defects in centriole architecture, including the formation of abnormal centrioles that lack the inner scaffold and triplet microtubules, resulting in a futile cycle of elongation and disintegration during cell division (Pudlowski2024A). This disruption not only affects the structural integrity of centrioles but also impacts their function during the cell cycle, highlighting the essential role of TEDC2 in cell division and stability (Pudlowski2024A).

Furthermore, TEDC2 is involved in recruiting inner scaffold proteins to the central core of the centriole, which is vital for restricting the length of the centriole's proximal end and maintaining its overall architecture through the cell cycle (Pudlowski2024A). This activity underscores the importance of TEDC2 in the dynamic and structural regulation of centrioles, which are critical for proper cell division and functioning.

## Clinical Significance
TEDC2 (Tubulin epsilon and delta complex 2) has been implicated in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), where its expression levels are significantly upregulated compared to normal tissues. In LUAD, high TEDC2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival (Fang2023TEDC2). Similarly, in KIRC and LIHC, TEDC2 expression correlates with advanced pathological stages and poor survival outcomes (Liu2024A).

Furthermore, TEDC2 expression influences the immune microenvironment in tumors. In LUAD, high TEDC2 levels correlate with low infiltration of immune cells such as dendritic cells and B cells, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Fang2023TEDC2). This gene also plays a role in the progression of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), where its increased expression is linked to enhanced cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a tumor-promoting role (Huang2022Identification).

Additionally, genetic alterations in TEDC2, including mutations and copy number changes, have been observed across various cancers, although these alterations do not significantly impact overall survival, indicating a complex role in tumorigenesis (Liu2024A).

## Interactions
TEDC2, along with TEDC1, forms a complex with delta-tubulin (TUBD1) and epsilon-tubulin (TUBE1), which is essential for the proper architecture and stability of centrioles. This interaction is crucial for the localization and function of these proteins at centrosomes, particularly at the proximal ends of parental centrioles and newly formed procentrioles (Pudlowski2024A). TEDC2 can physically interact with TEDC1 even in the absence of TUBD1 and TUBE1, suggesting a strong mutual dependency between TEDC1 and TEDC2 for their function (Pudlowski2024A). Structural predictions using AlphaFold-Multimer have supported these interaction patterns, showing high confidence in the interaction surfaces between TEDC1, TEDC2, and TUBD1 (Pudlowski2024A).

Furthermore, TEDC2 is involved in a protein complex that influences centriole architecture, as evidenced by the loss of TEDC1 or TEDC2 resulting in phenotypes similar to the loss of TUBD1 or TUBE1, characterized by the absence of triplet microtubules and the disintegration of centrioles during mitosis (Pudlowski2024A). These findings underscore the critical role of TEDC2 in centriole stability and function, contributing to the overall integrity of cell division and structure.
