# NFKBID

## Overview
NFKBID is a gene that encodes the nuclear protein IÎºBNS, a member of the nuclear IÎºB-like family characterized by ankyrin repeats. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the NF-ÎºB pathway, a key signaling mechanism involved in immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. Unlike typical IÎºB proteins that inhibit NF-ÎºB by sequestering it in the cytoplasm, IÎºBNS primarily functions within the nucleus and can act as both an activator and inhibitor of NF-ÎºB-dependent transcription, depending on the cellular context and specific stimuli (Arnold2012A). The gene and its protein product are crucial in the development and function of various immune cells, including T cells and regulatory T cells, and have been implicated in several immune-related disorders (Dwyer2022Nfkbid; Schuster2012IÎºBNS).

## Function
NFKBID encodes the protein IÎºBNS, which is a member of the nuclear IÎºB-like family of proteins characterized by ankyrin repeats. Unlike classical IÎºB proteins that regulate NF-ÎºB subunit translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, IÎºBNS resides in the nucleus and can act as either an activator or inhibitor of NF-ÎºB-dependent gene expression, depending on the cell type and stimuli (Arnold2012A). This dual function allows it to play a critical role in various immune responses. For instance, IÎºBNS positively regulates IL-2 transcription in stimulated T cells, but negatively regulates the expression of IL-6 and IL-12p40 in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Arnold2012A). Additionally, IÎºBNS is crucial for the differentiation of extrafollicular ASCs that mediate T-independent antibody responses and the early antibody response to T-dependent challenges (Arnold2012A).

Furthermore, NFKBID is involved in the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). It mediates the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3, critical for Treg cell development and function. Specifically, IÎºBNS is involved in the induction of Foxp3 by binding to the promoter and the conserved noncoding sequence 3 (CNS3) of the Foxp3 locus, which is vital for the transition of immature thymic Treg cell precursors into mature Foxp3+ Treg cells (Schuster2012IÎºBNS). This interaction highlights its essential role in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity.

## Clinical Significance
NFKBID (Nuclear Factor Kappa B Inhibitor Delta) plays a crucial role in immune regulation, and alterations in its expression or function are linked to various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Overexpression of NFKBID in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice leads to complete resistance to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) by enhancing the thymic deletion of pathogenic CD8 T-cells and increasing the number and functionality of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are essential for maintaining immune tolerance (Dwyer2022Nfkbid). Conversely, ablation or deficiency of NFKBID accelerates the onset of T1D, associated with a decrease in Treg numbers and their functionality, highlighting its protective role against autoimmune responses (Presa2018A; Dwyer2022Nfkbid).

Furthermore, NFKBID is implicated in the immune response to infections such as Toxoplasma gondii. NFKBID-null mice exhibit a complete failure to develop B-1 cells, lack circulating IgM and IgG3, and show no response to specific antigens, underscoring its essential role in humoral immunity and antibody responses (Souza2021Genetic).

These findings suggest that NFKBID is a critical modulator of immune responses, influencing both the development of autoimmune diseases like T1D and the immune system's ability to respond to infections. Variations in the expression or function of NFKBID could therefore have significant clinical implications, affecting susceptibility to autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
NFKBID, also known as IÎºBNS, is a nuclear IÎºB family protein that interacts with NF-ÎºB subunit proteins through its ankyrin repeat domains. These interactions are crucial for refining NF-ÎºB pathway signaling outcomes following TCR stimulation (Dwyer2022Nfkbid). Depending on the cell type and physiological context, NFKBID can act as either a negative or positive modulator of NF-ÎºB activity, influencing the transcription of genes involved in immune responses (Souza2020Nfkbidis). 

In the context of T cell regulation, NFKBID binds to the Il10 locus in Th17 cells, suggesting a direct interaction with nucleic acids that may influence gene expression (Dwyer2022Nfkbid). This interaction indicates a potential mechanism by which NFKBID could modulate immune responses by regulating cytokine production at the genetic level. Additionally, the protein's role in the immune system extends to its involvement in the development and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), where it impacts the expression of several functional markers and receptors crucial for Treg-mediated immunosuppression (Dwyer2022Nfkbid). 

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of NFKBID in immune regulation, impacting both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune responses.
