# AURKA

## Overview
AURKA, or Aurora kinase A, is a gene that encodes the protein aurora kinase A, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of mitosis. The AURKA gene is crucial for proper cell cycle progression, particularly during the mitotic phase, where its encoded protein plays a pivotal role in centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. Aurora kinase A is characterized by its kinase activity, which is essential for the phosphorylation of various substrates during cell division. Dysregulation of AURKA expression or function has been implicated in the development of several cancers, making it a significant target for cancer research and therapeutic intervention (Kollareddy2012Aurora; malumbres2014aurora). The protein's interaction with other cellular components and its regulation by phosphorylation highlight its complexity and importance in maintaining cellular function and genomic stability (Tang2017Aurora; Nikonova2012Aurora).

## Structure
Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a protein consisting of 403 amino acids, with a molecular structure that includes both ordered and disordered regions. The first 123 amino acids and the last 16 residues of AURKA are intrinsically disordered, which may contribute to its flexibility and interaction with various regulatory proteins (Nikonova2012Aurora). The structured portion of the protein encompasses a canonical kinase domain spanning residues 133-383, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity.

The kinase domain of AURKA features a five-stranded beta-sheet and two alpha-helices, known as the C-helix and B-helix. The C-terminal part of this domain contains seven alpha-helices and a two-stranded beta-sheet, which includes the catalytic aspartic acid of the HRD motif (His 254, Arg 255, Asp 256) (Nikonova2012Aurora). The activation loop, critical for determining the active or inactive state of the kinase, spans residues 274-299 and includes the DFG motif (Asp 274, Phe 275, Gly 276) (de2020Structural).

AURKA is regulated by phosphorylation at Thr 287 and Thr 288, and its activity is modulated by the binding of the mitotic spindle protein TPX2, which alters the conformation of the activation loop (de2020Structural). The protein also features a structural spine, divided into regulatory and catalytic spines, composed of specific residues that maintain the structural integrity necessary for kinase activity (de2020Structural).

## Function
Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cell division by regulating various stages of the mitotic process. It is crucial for the proper functioning of centrosomes, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. AURKA is activated by the LIM protein ajuba and reaches peak activity during the G2/M transition of the cell cycle, stimulating the separation of duplicated centrosomes and initiating mitotic entry (Tang2017Aurora). This kinase also recruits several pericentriolar proteins to the microtubule organizing centers, facilitating centrosome maturation and rapid microtubule nucleation (Tang2017Aurora).

During mitosis, AURKA localizes to the duplicate centrosomes and shifts to the bipolar spindle microtubules, playing a key role in the assembly of the mitotic spindle and chromosome segregation (Tang2017Aurora). The kinase is further activated after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane and is targeted to microtubules by TPX2, essential for spindle assembly and the formation of bipolar spindle microtubules (Tang2017Aurora).

At the conclusion of mitosis, AURKA is degraded by the cadherin-1(Cdh1)/APC/C complex, marking the end of its role in the mitotic process (Tang2017Aurora). The proper functioning of AURKA is essential for maintaining genetic stability, and its deletion or dysfunction can lead to mitotic errors, genetic instability, and increased tumor incidence (Tang2017Aurora).

## Clinical Significance
AURKA, or Aurora kinase A, plays a significant role in the progression and prognosis of various cancers due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and mitotic processes. Alterations in the expression and function of AURKA, such as amplification or overexpression, are frequently observed in cancers including breast, ovarian, bladder, and colorectal cancers. These alterations are often associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior (Park2008Quantitation; Kollareddy2012Aurora; Katsha2015Aurora; malumbres2014aurora).

In specific cancers, such as bladder and gastrointestinal cancers, AURKA overexpression correlates with increased aneuploidy and chromosomal instability, which are hallmarks of malignant cells (Park2008Quantitation; Katsha2015Aurora). Moreover, mutations in AURKA, like the F31I polymorphism, have been linked to familial breast cancer, suggesting a genetic predisposition facilitated by alterations in this gene (Kollareddy2012Aurora).

The interaction of AURKA with tumor suppressor genes, particularly p53, further underscores its clinical significance. Overexpression of AURKA can lead to the degradation of p53, thereby diminishing its tumor suppressive functions and facilitating tumorigenesis (Yan2016AuroraâA; Kollareddy2012Aurora). This interaction also contributes to resistance against certain cancer treatments, complicating therapeutic approaches (malumbres2014aurora).

Given these associations, AURKA is considered a critical target for cancer therapy, with ongoing research focused on developing inhibitors that could mitigate its oncogenic effects and improve treatment outcomes (malumbres2014aurora).

## Interactions
Aurora kinase A (AURKA) engages in multiple physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. AURKA interacts with TPX2, which is essential for its localization to the mitotic spindle and activation. The N-terminal amino acids of TPX2 bind to the C-terminal catalytic lobe of AURKA, a crucial interaction for AURKA's catalytic activity and proper spindle assembly (JaneÄek2016Allosteric; Nikonova2012Aurora). Additionally, AURKA forms complexes with TACC proteins and ch-TOG/XMAP215 family proteins to stabilize microtubules at centrosomes, influencing spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation (Nikonova2012Aurora).

AURKA is also involved in regulatory interactions that affect its stability and degradation. The protein is targeted by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Chfr for ubiquitination at its N-terminal A-box, while the C-terminal D-box interacts with PUM2, enhancing AURKA stability by preventing ubiquitination (Nikonova2012Aurora). Furthermore, AURKA phosphorylates and regulates GSK-3Î², influencing cell survival pathways and the nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin in cancer cells (Dar2008The).

These interactions underscore AURKA's integral role in mitotic processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by aberrant cell division, such as cancer.
