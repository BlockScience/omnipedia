# NPY

## Overview
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a gene that encodes the 36-amino acid peptide neurotransmitter, neuropeptide Y, which is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite regulation, stress response, and cardiovascular function. The NPY gene is located on chromosome 7 in humans and its expression is critical for the synthesis of the neuropeptide Y protein. This protein interacts with specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to exert its biological effects, which are crucial for maintaining energy balance, normal functioning of the nervous system, and adaptation to stress. Neuropeptide Y is one of the most abundant peptide neurotransmitters in the brain and has been implicated in several neurophysiological disorders, making it a significant focus of neurological and metabolic research (Pedrazzini2003Neuropeptide; DimitrijeviÄ2011The).

## Structure
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino acid peptide that exhibits a complex molecular structure, characterized by distinct conformational states depending on its environment. The primary structure of NPY consists of a single polypeptide chain of 36 residues, crucial for its biological functions (COWLEY1992Structure).

The secondary structure of NPY includes an amphipathic alpha-helix spanning residues 14-32, which is a common feature across various studies. This helical structure is noted for its strong hydrophobic interactions on one face, contributing to its stability and functional interactions (COWLEY1992Structure). Additionally, the N-terminal part of NPY is often unstructured and flexible, which plays a significant role in receptor interaction dynamics (Park2022Structural).

Tertiary structure insights reveal that NPY can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms. In its dimeric state, NPY molecules exhibit antiparallel packing with their curved helical units forming a hydrophobic core, crucial for functional dimerization (COWLEY1992Structure).

Quaternary structure analysis indicates that NPY dimerization involves hydrophobic interactions mainly involving tyrosine and isoleucine side chains, with the dimerization site located at the inner concave side of the curved helix (COWLEY1992Structure). This structural arrangement is essential for the biological activity of NPY, highlighting the importance of specific residues in maintaining functional integrity and receptor interaction.

## Function
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino acid peptide neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in humans. It is synthesized from a precursor protein, pre-pro-neuropeptide Y, which undergoes multiple posttranslational modifications to become biologically active (Pedrazzini2003Neuropeptide). NPY operates through several receptor subtypes, including Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5, and Y6, which are G protein-coupled receptors involved in a wide range of cellular functions (DimitrijeviÄ2011The).

In the central nervous system, NPY is one of the most abundant peptides and is involved in regulating food intake, energy balance, and neuroendocrine functions. It influences neuronal activity and neuroendocrine release, particularly under poor metabolic conditions (Pedrazzini2003Neuropeptide). NPY's interaction with its receptors leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase and modulation of intracellular calcium levels, which are critical for its role in neurotransmission and hormone release (Pedrazzini2003Neuropeptide).

In the peripheral nervous system, NPY is co-released with noradrenaline and plays a role in cardiovascular regulation, influencing heart rate and blood pressure. It also affects renal function by modulating sodium reabsorption and renin release, which are vital for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance (Medeiros1996Metabolism). Additionally, NPY is involved in the immune system, affecting functions such as cytokine secretion and natural killer cell activity, which are crucial for the body's defense mechanisms (DimitrijeviÄ2011The).

Overall, NPY's diverse roles in cell signaling and receptor interaction underscore its importance in maintaining homeostasis and responding to physiological changes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPY gene, such as the L7P substitution, have been linked to various cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. This specific mutation affects the secretion of Neuropeptide Y, influencing hemodynamic disturbances and sympathetic hyperactivity, which are critical in the development of cardiovascular diseases (2006 page 60 of 73). The L7P variant is also associated with increased body mass index and obesity-related phenotypes, as well as higher risks of myocardial infarction and stroke in hypertensive patients (Zhang2011The; 2006).

Alterations in NPY expression are implicated in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. For instance, dysregulation of NPY expression in the central nervous system is connected to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, where it may influence disease progression through its roles in neuroprotection and neuroinflammation (2006 page 60 of 73). Additionally, altered NPY levels are associated with mood disorders; decreased central NPY levels have been linked to major depression, while its modulation shows potential in treating anxiety and depression due to its anxiolytic-like properties (2006; Brothers2010Therapeutic).

Furthermore, NPY's role in metabolic regulation extends to diabetes, where elevated NPY levels contribute to insulin resistance, impaired glucose homeostasis, and beta cell dysfunction, suggesting its involvement in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (Yi2017A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NPY in a range of human diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) interacts with a variety of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically the Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5 receptors, which mediate different physiological responses. NPY binds to these receptors through specific interactions involving key amino acid residues. For instance, the interaction between the aspartic acid 6.59 residue within the extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) of Y1 and Y4 receptors and the arginine 35 of NPY is crucial for binding. A similar interaction occurs in the Y2 and Y5 receptors with arginine 33 of NPY (Babilon2013Towards). Additionally, the presence of arginine 25 within NPY is required for binding to Y2 and Y5 receptors, while Y1 and Y4 receptors are insensitive to the alanine mutation of this residue (Babilon2013Towards).

Moreover, NPY can form dimers, which may influence its interactions with its receptors. The dimerized form of NPY interacts with dimerized receptors, potentially affecting receptor behavior and signaling (Gehlert2007Co-expression). This dimerization is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and concentration, and involves extensive contacts between the alpha helices of the monomer units (Nordmann1999Aspects). These interactions highlight the complex nature of NPY's role in receptor binding and signaling, which is critical for its physiological functions.
