# SIGLEC8

## Overview
SIGLEC8 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 8 (Siglec-8), which is a single-pass transmembrane receptor belonging to the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family. This protein is primarily expressed on eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the context of inflammation and allergic reactions. Siglec-8 functions as an inhibitory receptor through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic tail, which are crucial for mediating downstream signaling pathways that modulate cell survival and activation (bochner2009siglec). The gene and its protein product are significant in clinical contexts, particularly in relation to allergic conditions such as asthma, where variations in SIGLEC8 have been associated with disease susceptibility and severity (Gao2010Polymorphisms).

## Structure
SIGLEC8 encodes the Siglec-8 protein, which is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family, characterized by an N-terminal V-set domain that binds sialic acid. This domain is followed by a variable number of immunoglobulin-like domains, which are typical features of the Siglec family, contributing to the protein's primary structure (bochner2009siglec; Youngblood2020Discovery). The protein is a single-pass transmembrane receptor, indicating a simple transmembrane region that anchors the protein to the cell membrane (bochner2009siglec).

The cytoplasmic tail of Siglec-8 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for its function as an inhibitory receptor. These motifs are involved in downstream signaling processes by recruiting phosphatases like SHP-1 (bochner2009siglec). The presence of ITIMs suggests that the secondary structure of the cytoplasmic domain is designed to facilitate these interactions, although specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature.

Additionally, Siglec-8 has a splice variant known as Siglec-8L, which differs in the cytoplasmic domain by including two tyrosine-based motifs found in other CD33-like Siglecs. This variant arises due to alternative splicing at exon six, leading to a distinct exon seven, which alters the protein's molecular composition and potentially its function (Foussias2000Molecular). This highlights the role of post-translational modifications and alternative splicing in diversifying the functions of the Siglec-8 protein within the immune system.

## Function
SIGLEC8, or sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 8, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system by regulating the function and survival of eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils. This protein is selectively expressed on these cells and is involved in inhibitory signaling pathways that modulate immune responses, particularly in the context of inflammation and allergic reactions.

The engagement of SIGLEC8 on eosinophils leads to apoptosis, a process that helps regulate eosinophil numbers and can mitigate allergic inflammation and asthma. This apoptotic pathway is distinct as it is not counteracted by survival signals typically provided by cytokines such as IL-5 and GM-CSF, which are known to promote eosinophil survival (bochner2009siglec).

In mast cells, SIGLEC8 engagement does not induce apoptosis but instead inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine and prostaglandin D2. This inhibition is crucial in controlling allergic reactions where excessive mediator release can lead to symptoms such as tissue swelling and bronchoconstriction (Yokoi2008Inhibition). The inhibitory effects of SIGLEC8 are mediated through its two tyrosine-based signaling domains, with the membrane-proximal domain resembling a classical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which is essential for its function (Yokoi2008Inhibition).

Overall, SIGLEC8 serves as a regulatory molecule that helps maintain immune homeostasis by controlling the activation and survival of key cells involved in allergic and inflammatory responses.

## Clinical Significance
SIGLEC8 mutations and alterations in its expression are significantly associated with susceptibility to allergic asthma. Studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SIGLEC8 gene, such as rs36498, which are linked to asthma susceptibility in various populations, including African Americans, Brazilians, and the Azeri population of Iran. Notably, the T allele of rs36498 acts as a protective allele against allergic asthma (Sajay-asbaghi2020Promoter; Gao2010Polymorphisms). Additionally, other SNPs like rs10409962 and rs6509541 have been associated with asthma and total IgE levels, respectively, further supporting the role of SIGLEC8 in allergic conditions (Gao2010Polymorphisms).

Beyond asthma, SIGLEC8's role in eosinophil apoptosis and its expression on eosinophils and mast cells suggest its involvement in other eosinophil-related disorders. However, studies have shown no significant association between SIGLEC8 polymorphisms and eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) in Caucasians, indicating a potential variability in the gene's impact across different conditions and ethnicities (Gao2010Polymorphisms).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of SIGLEC8 in the pathogenesis of asthma and potentially other allergic diseases, highlighting its value as a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating immune responses in these conditions.

## Interactions
SIGLEC8, a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin, engages in several critical physical interactions that modulate immune responses, particularly in mast cells and eosinophils. It interacts directly with FcÎµRI, a high-affinity receptor for IgE, which is central to allergic response mechanisms in mast cells. This interaction involves the co-immunoprecipitation of Siglec-8 with FcÎµRIg from unstimulated mast cell lysates, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction (Korver2022The). Additionally, Siglec-8's cytoplasmic domain contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit the SH2-containing protein phosphatase Shp-2 upon phosphorylation. This recruitment is crucial for inhibiting FcÎµRI-dependent signaling pathways in mast cells (Korver2022The).

Furthermore, Siglec-8 interacts with various signaling molecules downstream of FcÎµRI, such as Syk, Gab2, and Erk, among others. This interaction leads to a reduction in their phosphorylation, effectively inhibiting mast cell activation and degranulation (Korver2022The). In the context of eosinophils, Siglec-8 engagement upregulates and activates Î²2-integrins like CD11b, which are essential for eosinophil adhesion and do not trigger degranulation (Carroll2018Sialic). These interactions underline the dual role of Siglec-8 in both activating and inhibitory pathways across different cell types, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in allergic and other immune-related disorders.
