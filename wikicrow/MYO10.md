# MYO10

## Overview
MYO10 is a gene that encodes the protein myosin X, an unconventional myosin motor protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell motility, organelle transport, and cell division. Myosin X is distinguished by its ability to bind to actin filaments and is notably involved in the formation and maintenance of filopodia, dynamic structures that extend from the cell surface to interact with the extracellular environment. The protein structure includes a motor domain that hydrolyzes ATP to generate movement, a neck region containing IQ motifs for light chain binding, and a tail region that facilitates dimerization and includes multiple domains for interaction with other proteins. These structural features enable myosin X to link the actin cytoskeleton to various cellular components and signaling pathways, essential for its roles in supporting cellular architecture and transmitting intracellular signals (Heimsath2017Myosin-X; Bohil2006Myosin-X; Divito).

## Structure
MYO10, or myosin X, is a motor protein characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes a head, neck, and tail region. The head domain functions as a motor, binding to actin and hydrolyzing ATP to generate movement. This domain shares sequence identity with other myosins, notably 45% with Myo7a (Divito; Kerber2011Myosin-X:). The neck region contains three IQ motifs that bind calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains, which are essential for the regulation of the protein's motor activity (Heimsath2017Myosin-X; Bohil2006Myosin-X).

The tail region of MYO10 is particularly complex, beginning with a stable Î±-helix followed by a predicted coiled-coil region that facilitates dimerization, a critical feature for its function in filopodia (Heimsath2017Myosin-X; Divito). This region also includes three PEST sequences, which are sites for rapid protein turnover and potential cleavage by calpain (Kerber2011Myosin-X:). The tail concludes with three pleckstrin homology (PH) domains involved in signaling pathways, a MyTH4 domain that binds microtubules, and a FERM domain that interacts with Î²-integrins and other cytoplasmic domains of cell surface proteins (Bohil2006Myosin-X; Divito).

MYO10 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, including a 'headless' form, which lacks most of the motor domain but retains other functional domains, suggesting diverse roles in cellular processes (Heimsath2017Myosin-X). These structural features enable MYO10 to function effectively in linking the actin cytoskeleton to various cellular components and signaling pathways, crucial for its roles in cell motility and morphology.

## Function
MYO10, or myosin X, is an unconventional myosin motor protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by interacting with actin filaments. It is particularly noted for its localization to the tips of filopodia, slender cytoplasmic projections that are involved in cell movement and signaling. Myo10 is essential for the formation and function of filopodia, as experiments have shown that overexpression of Myo10 induces filopodia formation, while its knockdown inhibits it (Liu2012Myosin-X).

Beyond its role in filopodia, Myo10 is also involved in the formation of invadopodia and has critical functions in junction formation in polarized epithelial cells. It aids in the recruitment of key junctional proteins like E-cadherin and ZO-1, crucial for tight junction barrier formation. This is evidenced by experiments showing delayed junction assembly and increased paracellular permeability upon Myo10 knockdown (Liu2012Myosin-X).

Additionally, Myo10 plays a role in mitotic spindle function, particularly in spindle anchoring and maintaining spindle pole integrity. It binds to F-actin and microtubules through its N-terminal head and C-terminal tail domains, respectively. Disruption of Myo10 leads to the formation of multipolar spindles, indicating its role in stabilizing spindle poles during mitosis (Woolner2008Myosin-10).

In summary, Myo10 is integral to maintaining cellular structure and function, influencing cell motility, organelle transport, and cell division processes, which are vital for the proper functioning of healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
MYO10 (myosin X) is implicated in several diseases and conditions primarily due to its role in cell motility and its involvement in cancer progression. In glioblastoma (GBM), a type of brain cancer, MYO10 is crucial for tumor invasion and proliferation. Genetic deletion of MYO10 in GBM has been shown to impair tumor invasion, slow proliferation, and sensitize tumor cells to DNA damage repair inhibitors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kenchappa2020Myosin). Similarly, in breast cancer, elevated expression of MYO10 correlates with more aggressive clinicopathological features and poorer prognosis, indicating its role in cancer aggressiveness and metastasis (Cao2014Elevated). Furthermore, MYO10 is upregulated in various carcinomas, including lung and prostate cancers, and its expression level in melanoma correlates with metastatic capacity, underscoring its significance in cancer metastasis (Kenchappa2020Myosin).

In neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer, MYO10 is highly expressed and linked to poor overall survival. It acts as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation and contributing to chemotherapy resistance, which highlights its role in tumor growth and chemosensitivity (Wang2018miR-129). These findings collectively suggest that MYO10's alterations in expression or function can significantly impact disease progression and treatment outcomes in various cancers.

## Interactions
MYO10 (myosin X) interacts with various proteins through its distinct domains, facilitating crucial cellular functions. The MyTH4 domain of MYO10 is essential for binding to microtubules, which is integral for mitotic functions such as spindle pole integrity and positioning (Yim2023Myosin). Additionally, the FERM domain of MYO10 interacts with integrins, promoting cell adhesion during mitosis and influencing spindle orientation by facilitating the clustering of supernumerary centrosomes (Yim2023Myosin).

MYO10 also interacts with the actin-binding protein adducin-1 (ADD1). Phosphorylation of ADD1 by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 enhances its binding to MYO10, which is critical for proper spindle assembly and mitotic progression (Chan2013Adducin-1). Furthermore, MYO10's interaction with N-cadherin, particularly through its FERM domain binding to the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin, is significant in neuronal cells, affecting processes like radial migration in the cerebral cortex (Lai2015Myosin).

In the context of cancer, MYO10's interaction with vimentin has been observed to increase in tumor tissues, suggesting a role in cancer metastasis. This interaction is facilitated by the co-localization of MYO10 and vimentin, which affects MYO10's distribution and function in cells (Ostrowska-Podhorodecka2022Vimentin). These interactions underline the multifunctional role of MYO10 in cellular dynamics and disease mechanisms.
