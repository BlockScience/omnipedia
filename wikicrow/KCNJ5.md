# KCNJ5

## Overview
The KCNJ5 gene is responsible for encoding the potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 5 (Kir3.4), a protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of potassium ion flow across cell membranes. Kir3.4 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel family, crucial for maintaining the resting membrane potential and modulating cellular excitability. The protein can form both homotetrameric and heterotetrameric complexes with other GIRK family members, facilitating the selective permeability to potassium ions essential for various physiological processes including heart rate regulation and hormone secretion (Mulatero2012KCNJ5; Lenders2015KCNJ5). Mutations in KCNJ5 have been linked to several pathophysiological conditions, notably primary aldosteronism and cardiovascular disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Choi2011K; Scholl2012Hypertension).

## Structure
The KCNJ5 gene encodes the GIRK4 protein, which is a member of the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel family. The protein structure of GIRK4 includes two transmembrane helices that span the cell membrane, contributing to its ability to form a channel through which ions can pass. These transmembrane domains are connected by an extracellular pore-forming loop that includes a highly conserved Gly-Tyr-Gly sequence, crucial for the channel's selectivity for potassium ions over other cations (Lenders2015KCNJ5).

GIRK4 can form tetrameric structures, either as homotetramers or heterotetramers with other GIRK subunits such as GIRK1, GIRK2, or GIRK3. This quaternary structure is essential for the functional channel on the cell membrane, allowing potassium to flow into the cell, which is critical for maintaining the cell's electrical conductivity and signaling (Lenders2015KCNJ5).

The cytoplasmic domains of GIRK4, including the N and C termini, play a role in the channel's activation and interaction with cellular components like the G protein Î²Î³ subunit. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of the channel's activity in response to cellular signals (Lenders2015KCNJ5).

While the context provided does not detail specific post-translational modifications, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms, it is clear that the structural elements of GIRK4 are integral to its function in various tissues, including the heart, neurons, and endocrine tissues (Lenders2015KCNJ5).

## Function
The KCNJ5 gene encodes the potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 5 (Kir3.4), which is a crucial component of the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. These channels are predominantly involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating the electrical excitability of cells. Kir3.4 channels facilitate the selective flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane, which is essential for various cellular functions including cell volume regulation and maintaining the hyperpolarized state of cells (Mulatero2012KCNJ5; Rege2020Primary).

In the adrenal gland, particularly in the zona glomerulosa cells, Kir3.4 contributes significantly to the regulation of aldosterone production. This regulation is mediated through the maintenance of a negative membrane potential, which is crucial for the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent signaling pathways that stimulate aldosterone synthesis (Mulatero2012Role; Williams2015KCNJ5). Additionally, Kir3.4 is involved in the heart, where it forms part of the acetylcholine-activated potassium channel (IKACh channel), playing a vital role in controlling heart rate by mediating the heart rate slowing response to parasympathetic stimulation (Yamada2019Mutant).

Overall, the KCNJ5 gene through its product, Kir3.4, is integral in controlling the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane, influencing cell excitability and hormone production, which are critical for normal physiological functions across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNJ5 gene are significantly associated with primary aldosteronism, a condition characterized by excessive aldosterone production leading to hypertension. The gene encodes the Kir3.4 potassium channel, and mutations, particularly G151R and L168R, are prevalent in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs). These mutations alter the channel's selectivity filter, allowing sodium to enter the cells, which triggers membrane depolarization and subsequent aldosterone production and adrenal cell proliferation (Choi2011K; ÃkerstrÃ¶m2012Comprehensive; Scholl2012Hypertension).

Inherited mutations in KCNJ5, such as T158A, have been identified in familial cases of primary aldosteronism characterized by severe hypertension and massive adrenal hyperplasia. These mutations result in altered ion selectivity of the KCNJ5 channel, particularly affecting the K+:Na+ permeability ratio, leading to membrane depolarization and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels (Choi2011K; Scholl2012Hypertension).

Additionally, a rare form of long QT syndrome (type 13) has been reported to be caused by a loss-of-function mutation in KCNJ5, linking the gene to cardiovascular conditions related to electrolyte imbalances (Al-Salameh2014Overview). The presence of these mutations is linked to altered aldosterone synthesis and cardiovascular conditions related to electrolyte imbalances, highlighting the clinical significance of KCNJ5 in various adrenal and cardiovascular disorders.

## Interactions
KCNJ5 encodes the GIRK4 protein, which forms functional channel complexes with other subunits such as GIRK1 (KCNJ3) in a 2:2 stoichiometry, typically activated by the Î²Î³ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi/o class upon agonist activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Kienitz2015NCI-H295R). In some native environments, homotetrameric GIRK4 channels can also be activated independently by high concentrations of intracellular Na+ ions. The protein is involved in forming heteromultimers with KCNJ3, resulting in highly active channels, or less active homomultimers (Taguchi2012Expression). 

Recent studies have expanded the understanding of KCNJ5's interactome in cardiac tissues, identifying 45 protein interactors that influence its function in cardiac electrophysiology, potentially affecting channel expression, localization, and the orchestration of the cardiac electrical impulse (Maurya2023Outlining). Additionally, KCNJ5 is part of a network with other inward rectifier potassium channels like KCNJ2 and KCNJ3, indicating shared interacting proteins that might be physically clustered together in cardiomyocytes (Maurya2023Outlining).

Furthermore, mutations in KCNJ5, such as G151R and L168R, have been linked to altered ion selectivity and membrane potential changes, impacting calcium dynamics and cellular proliferation in the context of aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) (Taguchi2012Expression). These mutations can impair the interaction of GIRK4 with the GÎ²Î³ subunit of G proteins, crucial for the proper functioning of the channel (Shalomov2022A).
