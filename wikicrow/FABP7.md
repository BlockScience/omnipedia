# FABP7

## Overview
FABP7, or Fatty Acid Binding Protein 7, is a gene that encodes the brain-type fatty acid binding protein, also known as Brain Lipid Binding Protein (BLBP). This protein is integral to the intracellular transport of fatty acids, particularly within the brain, and is predominantly expressed in astrocytes, neural stem cells, and radial glia. FABP7 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes including the uptake and distribution of fatty acids, signal transduction, and gene transcription. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are essential for maintaining cell membrane integrity and proper signaling pathways. The gene and its protein product are involved in critical biological functions and have been implicated in several clinical conditions, making them significant in both neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics (Sharifi2011FABP7; Ebrahimi2015Astrocyteâexpressed).

## Structure
FABP7, also known as Brain Fatty Acid Binding Protein (B-FABP), is characterized by a molecular structure that includes a Î²-barrel composed of 10 antiparallel Î²-strands organized into two Î²-sheets oriented nearly orthogonally. This Î²-barrel is capped on one end by a small helix-loop-helix region, which contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that becomes visible in the three-dimensional structure upon binding with activating ligands (Kagawa2019Role). The tertiary structure of FABP7 consists of these Î²-strands forming a Î²-barrel and two Î±-helices, with a cavity approximately 500 Ã in size for binding hydrophobic molecules such as fatty acids (Lenz2021FABP7).

Specific amino acids play crucial roles in the functionality of FABP7. For instance, lysine at position 21, arginine at position 30, and glutamine at position 31 are essential for the 3D-NLS, while phenylalanine at position 104, arginine at position 126, and tyrosine at position 128 are important for binding fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Kagawa2019Role).

The protein's interaction with membranes and micelles is influenced by its structural features, particularly the portal region composed of the Î±-helices and specific loops, which plays a crucial role in ligand transfer (Lenz2021FABP7).

## Function
Fatty Acid Binding Protein 7 (FABP7), also known as Brain Lipid Binding Protein (BLBP), is a protein that plays a significant role in the intracellular transport of fatty acids within the brain. It is primarily expressed in astrocytes, neural stem cells, and radial glia, where it is involved in various cellular processes including the uptake and intracellular distribution of fatty acids, signal transduction, and gene transcription (KIPP2011Brain; Ebrahimi2015Astrocyteâexpressed). FABP7 preferentially binds to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of cell membranes and signaling pathways (Sharifi2011FABP7).

In astrocytes, FABP7 regulates lipid raft function through the control of caveolin-1 expression and is involved in the astrocytic response to external stimuli (Ebrahimi2015Astrocyteâexpressed). It also plays a critical role in neurogenesis by regulating the proliferation of neural stem progenitor cells, influenced by Pax6 and Notch signaling pathways (Ebrahimi2015Astrocyteâexpressed). Additionally, FABP7 is detected in astrocytic perisynaptic compartments, suggesting a role in synaptic homeostasis or complex behavioral processes (Ebrahimi2015Astrocyteâexpressed).

FABP7's function extends to the protection of astrocytes against oxidative stress by facilitating the accumulation of lipid droplets, which helps in managing reactive oxygen species (ROS) toxicity and enhances antioxidant defense mechanisms (Islam2019FABP7). This protective mechanism is crucial in preventing apoptosis in astrocytes under stress conditions, highlighting FABP7's role in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage (Islam2019FABP7).

## Clinical Significance
FABP7, also known as Brain-type Fatty Acid Binding Protein, has been implicated in various cancers and psychiatric disorders due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In breast cancer, increased mRNA levels of FABP7 correlate with longer recurrence-free survival, particularly in patients with ER-negative subtypes, suggesting its role as a favorable prognostic biomarker and its potential in predicting responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Xie2020FABP7). Conversely, in melanoma, FABP7 expression is higher in primary tumors than in metastatic forms, and its decreased expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker for early-stage melanoma (Goto2010Aberrant).

In the context of renal cell carcinoma, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), overexpression of FABP7 is linked to poor prognosis, higher tumor volume, and advanced clinical stages (Zhou2015Overexpression). Additionally, FABP7 has been associated with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, where its genetic variations are linked to alterations in biological markers like prepulse inhibition, a measure commonly disturbed in schizophrenia (Iwayama2010Association).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of FABP7 across a spectrum of diseases, highlighting its potential as both a therapeutic target and a biomarker for various cancers and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
FABP7, also known as brain fatty acid-binding protein, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of the key interactions of FABP7 is with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³). This interaction is enhanced by the treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), leading to increased levels of FABP7-PPARÎ³ protein complexes in astrocytes, as evidenced by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays. This interaction facilitates the transcriptional activity of PPARÎ³, affecting genes involved in inflammation and cell adhesion (Tripathi2016Docosahexaenoic; Elsherbiny2013Interaction).

Additionally, FABP7 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with various transcription factors. It binds to the FABP7 promoter region, interacting with transcription factors such as POU3F2, POU3F3, PBX1, PKNOX1, and PAX6. NFIC, which has multiple binding sites on the FABP7 promoter, and Coup-TF1 also interact with this region, suggesting a complex regulatory network influencing FABP7 expression and function in cells (De2012A).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of FABP7 in cellular signaling, gene regulation, and its potential implications in various biological processes and diseases.
