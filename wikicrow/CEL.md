# CEL

## Overview
The CEL gene, located on chromosome 9 in humans, encodes the enzyme carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), which is a key player in lipid metabolism. This enzyme, which is not a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of dietary lipids, aiding in the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. CEL is synthesized predominantly in the pancreas and secreted into the intestinal lumen, where it interacts with bile salts to facilitate its enzymatic activity. The protein encoded by the CEL gene is characterized by a complex structure that includes a signal peptide, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal region enriched with O-glycosylation sites, which are crucial for its stability and function. Mutations in the CEL gene have been associated with various metabolic and pancreatic disorders, underscoring its importance in human health and disease (Hui2002Carboxyl; Reue1991cDNA; Wu2023Identification).

## Structure
The human CEL gene encodes the carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) protein, which plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of ester bonds in triglycerides and cholesterol esters. The CEL protein is approximately 79 kDa in size and consists of a primary structure of 745 amino acids, with a notable variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the last exon, typically ranging from 7 to 23 repeats (Johansson2011Diabetes).

The secondary structure of CEL includes an N-terminal globular catalytic core domain and a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region. The catalytic core domain spans residues 1-558 and includes a signal peptide (residues 1-23), while the C-terminal region, composed of tandem repeats, spans residues 559-745 (Johansson2011Diabetes).

In terms of tertiary structure, the core domain is prone to aggregation and forms inclusion bodies when overexpressed in bacteria, indicating a complex folding pattern that requires solubilization with 8 M urea (Johansson2011Diabetes).

Post-translational modifications of the CEL protein include co-translational N-glycosylation at Asn-210 and extensive O-glycosylation in the C-terminal region, particularly on Thr residues adjacent to PVPP motifs within the first 10 repeats. This glycosylation is crucial for the protein's stability and function (Johansson2011Diabetes).

The quaternary structure of CEL, particularly in its mutant form (CEL-MUT), includes the formation of higher oligomeric structures that are SDS-resistant and Triton X-100-insoluble, suggesting alterations in its quaternary structure compared to the wild-type (Johansson2011Diabetes).

## Function
Carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), encoded by the human gene CEL, is a multifunctional enzyme crucial for lipid metabolism, particularly in the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids. CEL hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of substrates including cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols, and fat-soluble vitamins, facilitating their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (Hui2002Carboxyl; Taylor1991Carboxyl). This enzyme is predominantly synthesized in the pancreas and secreted into the intestinal lumen where it plays a significant role in the digestion of dietary fats (Reue1991cDNA).

In the pancreas, CEL contributes to the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons, essential for transporting dietary fats from the intestines to other parts of the body (Hui2002Carboxyl). The enzyme's interaction with bile salts, facilitated by specific arginine residues, is critical for its activation and function in lipid hydrolysis (Hui2002Carboxyl). CEL also exhibits unique lipoamidase activity, particularly in hydrolyzing ceramide, which is vital for the proper assembly of lipoprotein particles in the intestinal tract (Hui2002Carboxyl).

Moreover, CEL is involved in the metabolism of lipoproteins and may influence the development of atherosclerosis through its interaction with oxidized LDL (Hui2002Carboxyl). The enzyme is also present in plasma, where it interacts with cholesterol and oxidized lipoproteins, potentially influencing the progression of atherosclerosis (Holmes2011Comparative). This broad range of activities underscores CEL's essential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis and overall metabolic health in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEL gene, which encodes carboxyl ester lipase, are implicated in various forms of diabetes and pancreatic disorders. Notably, the gene is linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY8), a condition that typically manifests before age 25. Specific mutations, including point mutations and deletions, have been identified in patients with MODY8, type 1, and type 2 diabetes. These mutations often result in protein misfolding, reduced transcript levels, and impaired enzyme function, which can disrupt lipid metabolism and contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes (Wu2023Identification).

In addition to diabetes, CEL gene mutations are associated with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. The gene's polymorphic nature leads to a variety of mutations, such as missense/nonsense mutations and small insertions/deletions, which affect the protein's folding, secretion, and stability. These alterations can impair the enzyme's normal function, leading to exocrine dysfunction and potentially contributing to the development of pancreatic diseases (Wu2023Identification).

Despite the established links to specific pancreatic conditions and diabetes subtypes, the role of CEL in common forms of diabetes remains less clear, highlighting an area for further research to elucidate its broader clinical implications (Wu2023Identification).
