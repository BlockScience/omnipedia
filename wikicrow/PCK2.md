# PCK2

## Overview
PCK2, or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, mitochondrial, is a gene that encodes for an enzyme crucial in the metabolic pathway of gluconeogenesis. This enzyme, located primarily in the mitochondria, plays a pivotal role in converting oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate, facilitating the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. This process is vital during periods when dietary glucose is scarce, ensuring stable blood glucose levels. The protein encoded by PCK2 is not only essential for glucose metabolism but also participates in maintaining the balance of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle through anaplerosis and cataplerosis (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate). Additionally, PCK2 has roles beyond its enzymatic functions, including involvement in cellular proteostasis and insulin secretion regulation, highlighting its importance in both metabolic and cellular health (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate; de2024The).

## Function
PCK2 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, mitochondrial) is a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, primarily located in the mitochondria of cells. It catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a critical step in the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, which is essential during periods of low dietary glucose availability to maintain blood sugar levels (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate). Beyond its role in gluconeogenesis, PCK2 is involved in various metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It participates in anaplerosis and cataplerosis, processes crucial for maintaining the balance of intermediate metabolites in the TCA cycle (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate).

In pancreatic Î²-cells, PCK2 plays a vital role in glucose homeostasis by regulating insulin secretion. It uses mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP) as a phosphate donor to enhance the production of PEP, which stimulates insulin release upon glucose stimulation. This mechanism is significant for promoting glucose-stimulated biphasic insulin secretion, a critical process for maintaining glucose levels in the blood (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate).

Additionally, PCK2 has a non-enzymatic role in proteostasis, particularly in endothelial cells (ECs). It is involved in maintaining protein balance and function within the cell, crucial for cellular health and function under glucose-deprived conditions (de2024The). This includes regulating the unfolded protein response and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which is essential for maintaining endothelial cell function and viability, particularly under metabolic stress induced by glucose deprivation (de2024The).

## Clinical Significance
PCK2 mutations and alterations in expression have been implicated in various human diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. In lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, mutations in PCK2 are relatively rare but significant, with a mutation rate of 0.53%. High expression levels of PCK2 in lung adenocarcinoma are associated with better overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tang2023PCK2). Additionally, PCK2 has been linked to primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) through a novel mutation, c.977C>T, which induces apoptosis in retinal cells and affects the AKT/GSK3Î± signaling pathway, crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Xu2021A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, a non-synonymous somatic variant of PCK2 has been identified, suggesting a role in the disease's progression and possibly in carcinoma cell proliferation (LIU2012Whole-exome). Furthermore, PCK2's involvement in gluconeogenesis links it to metabolic disorders when dysregulated, although specific diseases resulting from such dysregulation in humans are not detailed in the provided contexts.

## Interactions
PCK2 interacts with various proteins, influencing cellular processes and signaling pathways. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, PCK2's interaction with Rkp1/Cpc2 and the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain of human PLCÎ³1 inhibits its kinase activity, which is crucial for cell viability and shape regulation (Won2001Pleckstrin). Additionally, the HR1 domain of PCK2 is essential for its interaction with Rho1, affecting the protein's stability and kinase activity, which plays a significant role in cell division and viability (Sayers2000Rhoâdependence).

In osteosarcoma, PCK2 is part of a protein interaction network involving PQBP1, SF3A2, and UBA52, where it acts as a hub gene. This network is crucial for understanding PCK2's role in tumor biology and metastasis (Zhang2019High). Furthermore, in lung adenocarcinoma, PCK2's interactions are analyzed using databases like GeneMania and STRING to elucidate its role in oxidative stress-induced senescence and immune escape of tumor cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tang2023PCK2). These interactions underscore PCK2's involvement in crucial cellular mechanisms across different organisms and conditions.
