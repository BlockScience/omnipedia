# MYOM1

## Overview
MYOM1 is a gene that encodes the protein myomesin-1, which plays a crucial role in the structural and functional integrity of muscle cells, particularly within the M-band of sarcomeres. Myomesin-1, a structural protein, is characterized by its composition of immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate its interaction with other sarcomeric proteins such as myosin and titin. These interactions are essential for maintaining the alignment and structural integrity of the sarcomere during muscle contraction and relaxation. The protein is involved in several key processes including the stabilization of contractile filaments, calcium homeostasis, and mechanical sensing within muscle tissues. Mutations in the MYOM1 gene have been linked to various muscular and cardiac disorders, highlighting its importance in muscle function and cardiac health (Schoenauer2008Myomesin; Hang2021Knockout).

## Structure
MYOM1 encodes the myomesin protein, which is integral to the structural integrity of muscle cells, particularly within the M-band of sarcomeres. The primary structure of myomesin includes a series of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and fibronectin type III (Fn3) domains. Specifically, the protein is composed of seven Ig domains and five Fn3 domains arranged in a distinct sequence: Ig-Ig-Fn3-Fn3-Fn3-Fn3-Fn3-Ig-Ig-Ig-Ig-Ig (Tskhovrebova2012Making). The secondary structure features Î±-helices linking the C-terminal Ig domains, which are crucial for the protein's function and stability (Lamber2022The).

In terms of tertiary structure, myomesin forms a long tail-to-tail filament structure that includes a central dimerized domain, allowing for reversible elongation under mechanical stress, contributing to the protein's elasticity (Lamber2022The). The quaternary structure involves the dimerization of myomesin through its C-terminal Ig domain, essential for forming M-bridges in the M-band, which help maintain the sarcomere's structural integrity during muscle contraction and relaxation (Tskhovrebova2012Making).

Myomesin undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including a variant with a 96 amino-acid insertion known as the embryonic heart (EH) sequence, which is common across all species, and a second variant found only in avian muscles (Lamber2022The). Post-translational modifications of myomesin, such as phosphorylation, may regulate its interaction with other proteins like titin and obscurin (Fukuzawa2008Interactions).

## Function
MYOM1 encodes myomesin-1, a protein integral to the structural integrity and function of the sarcomere, particularly at the M-band of striated muscles. Myomesin-1 is crucial for the proper interaction and stabilization of contractile filaments during muscle contraction. It cross-links thick filaments primarily through interactions with myosin and titin, maintaining the alignment and integrity of the sarcomere (Schoenauer2008Myomesin; Hang2021Knockout). The protein is composed of various domains, including immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate its structural and functional roles in muscle fibers (Hang2021Knockout).

Myomesin-1 also plays a significant role in calcium homeostasis within cardiomyocytes, influencing both sarcomere assembly and calcium signaling pathways, which are vital for muscle contraction and relaxation (Hang2021Knockout). The protein's ability to stretch significantly under low molecular stress suggests a role in mechanical sensing within the muscle, potentially contributing to the muscle's ability to respond to mechanical changes (Hang2021Knockout).

Moreover, myomesin-1 is involved in the organization of myofibrils and the maintenance of sarcomere structure, which are essential for the proper functioning and structural integrity of muscle tissues (Speel1998Assignment). The absence of myomesin-1 leads to sarcomere disorder, reduced cell volume, and impaired contractility in cardiomyocytes, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cardiac function and structure (Hang2021Knockout).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYOM1 gene, which encodes the myomesin-1 protein, have been linked to various cardiac and muscular disorders. A specific mutation identified as V1490I in the MYOM1 gene is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle which can lead to heart failure and sudden cardiac death. This mutation affects the protein's ability to dimerize, which is crucial for its function in the structural integrity of the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle fibers (Siegert2011A).

Additionally, knockout studies of MYOM1 in human cardiomyocytes have shown that the absence of this gene leads to myocardial atrophy, impaired calcium homeostasis, and significant changes in cardiomyocyte structure and function. These changes include decreased contractility and alterations in calcium signaling pathways, which are vital for muscle contraction and heart function (Hang2021Knockout). The knockout of MYOM1 also results in the disintegration of myofibrils and cardiac atrophy, further underscoring the gene's essential role in maintaining cardiac structure and function (Hang2021Knockout). 

These findings highlight the critical role of MYOM1 in cardiac health and disease, suggesting that mutations or disruptions in its normal function can lead to serious cardiac conditions.

## Interactions
MYOM1 (myomesin 1) is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions within the sarcomere, particularly at the M-band, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of muscle cells. MYOM1 binds to myosin via its N-terminal domain and to titin, facilitating the cross-linking of these filaments within the sarcomere (Schoenauer2008Myomesin; Lamber2022The). This interaction with titin is mediated through the Ig domain m4 of titin and the Fn domains My4-My6 of MYOM1, contributing significantly to the mechanical stability of the sarcomere (Lamber2022The).

Additionally, MYOM1 interacts with the Obscurin family proteins, including Obscurin/OBSCN and Obscurin-like-1/OBSL1. The interaction with Obscurin and OBSL1 occurs through the linker region between domains My4 and My5 of MYOM1, which is crucial for targeting these proteins to the M-band and maintaining the overall structure of myofibrils (Fukuzawa2008Interactions). MYOM1 also interacts dynamically with muscle-type creatine kinase (MM-CK) at domains My7-My8, which plays a role in the muscle's energy dynamics by facilitating the transfer of energy within the sarcomere (Lamber2022The).

These interactions are not only pivotal for the assembly and stabilization of the sarcomeric structure but also suggest a role in mechanical sensing and response, which is critical for muscle function and integrity.
