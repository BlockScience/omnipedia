# EWSR1

## Overview
EWSR1, or EWS RNA binding protein 1, is a gene located on chromosome 22q12.2 that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and signal transduction. The EWSR1 protein is characterized by its ability to bind RNA and DNA, facilitated by multiple domains including a transactivation domain, RNA-binding domains, and arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) boxes. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, influencing numerous cellular functions and organismal outcomes. EWSR1 is also notable for its involvement in gene fusions, particularly in various types of sarcomas, where these fusions lead to the production of chimeric proteins that drive oncogenesis (Tsuda2020The; Fisher2013The). The clinical significance of EWSR1 extends to its role in the diagnosis and treatment of these cancers, making it a crucial focus of medical research and therapy (Flucke2021EWSR1âThe).

## Structure
The EWSR1 protein is composed of 656 amino acids and exhibits a complex molecular structure that supports its role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. The primary structure of EWSR1 includes an N-terminal domain encoded by the first 7 exons, which contains a transactivation domain with a consensus sequence SYGQ (Cantile2013Molecular). This domain is crucial for the protein's function in activating transcription. The C-terminal of the protein contains three arginine-and glycine-rich (RGG) tracts encoded by exons 8-9, 14, and 16, and an RNA-binding domain encoded by exon 17, which facilitates RNA and single-strand DNA interactions (Romeo2009Soft).

EWSR1 also features several specialized domains, including two auto-regulation regions (IQ and SF1), three RGG domains, an RNA-binding domain (RBD), and a ring finger domain similar to RAN-BP2 (Cantile2013Molecular). The RNA-binding domain is particularly significant, encoded by exons 11-13, and is a consistent feature across the TET family of proteins, to which EWSR1 belongs (Fisher2013The).

Details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of EWSR1 are not specified in the provided sources. Similarly, information on prominent folds, common post-translational modifications, and splice variant isoforms is not detailed enough for inclusion.

## Function
EWSR1 (EWS RNA binding protein 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcription, RNA splicing, and cellular signal transduction. It interacts with basal transcription factors such as TFIID and RNA Polymerase II, modulating gene transcription through its interaction with the CREB-binding protein (CBP). This interaction is essential for the regulation of gene expression, which influences numerous cellular functions and organismal outcomes (Lee2019EWSR1).

In addition to its role in transcription, EWSR1 is involved in posttranscriptional mRNA splicing, cooperating with multiple splicing factors. This activity is critical for the proper processing of pre-mRNA into mature mRNA, affecting the expression of genes involved in various biological pathways (Lee2019EWSR1).

EWSR1 also plays a role in the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) through its influence on Drosha, a key enzyme in the miRNA biogenesis pathway. This regulation impacts processes such as autophagy and dermal development by modulating the levels of miRNAs that target specific mRNAs for degradation (Lee2019EWSR1).

Furthermore, EWSR1 is essential for maintaining the quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells, with its deficiency leading to early onset of senescence in these cells. This indicates its significant role in stem cell biology and potentially in aging (Lee2019EWSR1). The protein's involvement in these complex networks underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress.

## Clinical Significance
EWSR1 (EWS RNA binding protein 1) gene mutations and translocations are pivotal in the development of various sarcomas and tumors, significantly impacting clinical outcomes and treatment strategies. EWSR1 is frequently involved in gene fusions, forming chimeric proteins that act as aberrant transcription factors, which are crucial in oncogenesis. These gene fusions are characteristic of Ewing sarcoma and related neoplasms, where EWSR1 typically fuses with FLI1 or ERG, among other ETS family transcription factors (Tsuda2020The; Flucke2021EWSR1âThe).

Apart from Ewing sarcoma, EWSR1 rearrangements are associated with a variety of other tumors. These include desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma, where the gene fuses with different transcription factors leading to diverse tumor pathology (Krystel-Whittemore2019Novel; Romeo2009Soft). Additionally, novel EWSR1 fusions have been identified in conditions such as cerebral ganglioglioma and pediatric high-grade gliomas, underscoring the gene's role in a broad spectrum of cancers (Chougule2019Spindle).

The identification of specific EWSR1 fusion partners is crucial for accurate histological diagnosis and can significantly influence treatment decisions, highlighting the clinical importance of detecting these genetic alterations (Krystel-Whittemore2019Novel).

## Interactions
EWSR1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, and cellular signaling. It associates with the general transcription factor TFIID and tissue-specific transcription factors such as Oct4 and Brn3a, which underscores its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Wang2016EWSR1). Additionally, EWSR1 binds with the basal transcription factor TFIID and the RNA polymerase II complex, further facilitating transcription initiation (Cantile2013Molecular). 

In the context of RNA splicing, EWSR1 interacts with YB-1, a splicing activator, and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing through its associations with CCNL1 (cyclin L1) and TFIP11 (Cantile2013Molecular; Tannukit2008TFIP11). The protein's interaction with EP300 and CREBBP as a coactivator also mediates the activation of genes like FOS and HNF4, indicating its role in transcriptional coactivation (Cantile2013Molecular).

EWSR1's involvement in DNA recombination and repair is suggested through its coupling with BRAD1, a partner of the BRCA1 gene (Wang2016EWSR1). Moreover, it interacts with Aurora B kinase, a component of the chromosome passenger complex, critical for checkpoint control in mitosis (Wang2016EWSR1). This interaction highlights EWSR1's role in the mitotic process and its potential impact on genomic stability.
