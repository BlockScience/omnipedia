# EGLN1

## Overview
EGLN1, or egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 1, is a gene that encodes the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2). This enzyme is crucial in the cellular response to oxygen availability, primarily functioning to hydroxylate the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) Î± subunit. This post-translational modification is essential for the regulation of HIF under normoxic (normal oxygen) conditions, facilitating the degradation of HIF via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The activity of EGLN1 is pivotal in maintaining cellular oxygen homeostasis, influencing various physiological processes including angiogenesis, metabolism, and cell survival. The protein encoded by EGLN1, PHD2, is not a receptor or kinase but functions as a hydroxylase, an enzyme that adds a hydroxyl group to its substrates, thereby regulating their activity (Delamare2023Characterization; Shams2023HarnessingEGLN1Gene).

## Function
EGLN1, also known as prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2), is a key enzyme in the cellular response to oxygen levels. It primarily functions by hydroxylating the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) Î± subunit at specific proline residues, a modification that is crucial for the regulation of HIF under normal oxygen conditions. This hydroxylation promotes the binding of hydroxylated HIF-Î± to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which targets HIF-Î± for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Delamare2023Characterization). This degradation process prevents the accumulation of HIF-Î± in the nucleus, thereby inhibiting its ability to activate genes that respond to low oxygen levels (Delamare2023Characterization).

Under normoxic conditions, the activity of EGLN1 ensures that HIF1A levels remain low, preventing unnecessary activation of oxygen-sensitive genes. This regulatory mechanism is vital for maintaining cellular oxygen homeostasis (price2019genome). However, under hypoxic conditions, the activity of EGLN1 decreases, leading to the stabilization of HIF-1Î±. This results in the activation of a broad range of biological processes aimed at responding to low oxygen levels, including angiogenesis, which is crucial for restoring oxygen supply to tissues (Shams2023HarnessingEGLN1Gene).

EGLN1's function is not only pivotal in oxygen sensing but also plays a significant role in various physiological processes such as angiogenesis, metabolism, and cell survival, influencing overall organismal outcomes (Shams2023HarnessingEGLN1Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EGLN1 gene, which encodes prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2), are primarily associated with hereditary erythrocytosis, a condition characterized by an excessive production of red blood cells. These mutations often result in a loss of function of the PHD2 enzyme, leading to deregulated erythropoietin (Epo) production and elevated hematocrit levels, despite normal Epo levels (Delamare2023Characterization; Bento2013Genetic). Specific mutations such as PHD2-P200Q, N203K, and K204E among others, have been directly linked to erythrocytosis (Gardie2014The).

Additionally, certain EGLN1 mutations are associated with other health conditions. For instance, the R371H mutation is linked to recurrent paraganglioma, a rare tumor that can develop at various body sites (Gardie2014The). Other complications such as thrombosis, hypertension, renal cysts, and angiomas have also been reported in patients with these mutations (Delamare2023Characterization).

Interestingly, EGLN1 mutations have been implicated in the adaptation of Tibetans to high altitudes, suggesting a complex interaction of these genetic alterations with environmental factors (Gardie2014The). This highlights the diverse roles of EGLN1 mutations not only in disease but also in physiological adaptations.

## Interactions
EGLN1, also known as Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-Containing Protein 2 (PHD2), interacts with Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) by hydroxylating it, which promotes its binding to the Von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), leading to HIF1A's ubiquitination and degradation under oxygenated conditions (price2019genome). This interaction is crucial for regulating cellular responses to oxygen levels. Inhibition of EGLN1 stabilizes HIF1A, reducing cell proliferation, which highlights its role in tumor growth and cellular proliferation (price2019genome). Additionally, EGLN1 interacts with RNA Polymerase II, specifically inhibiting the hydroxylation of proline 1465 on its large subunit, Rpb1, which is essential for gene expression regulation (Haffey2009iTRAQ).

EGLN1 also interacts with various proteins in response to hypoxia, such as EPAS1, another hypoxia-inducible factor, under low oxygen conditions, allowing the accumulation of HIF proteins that activate downstream target genes (Graham2019Convergent). Furthermore, EGLN1's interaction with nitric oxide (NO) involves the inhibition of its hydroxylase activity, which can affect its interaction with other proteins or small molecules (Chowdhury2011Studies). These interactions underline EGLN1's pivotal role in cellular adaptation to varying oxygen levels and its involvement in multiple regulatory pathways that influence cell survival and proliferation.
