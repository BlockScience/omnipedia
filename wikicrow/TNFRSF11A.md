# TNFRSF11A

## Overview
TNFRSF11A is a gene that encodes the protein TNF receptor superfamily member 11a, commonly known as RANK. RANK is a type I transmembrane receptor protein that plays a pivotal role in bone remodeling and immune system regulation. It is primarily involved in the activation and differentiation of osteoclasts, cells critical for bone resorption, through its interaction with its ligand RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Ligand). This interaction is essential for the activation of several signaling pathways, including NF-ÎºB, which are crucial for bone metabolism and immune responses. Mutations in TNFRSF11A can lead to various bone disorders, highlighting its significance in skeletal health and disease (Okamoto2017Osteoimmunology:; Crockett2010New).

## Structure
TNFRSF11A encodes the protein known as Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Îº B (RANK), which is a type I transmembrane protein. The protein structure of TNFRSF11A includes an intracellular C-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular N-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is characterized by four cysteine-rich repeat motifs essential for receptor trimerization and interaction with its ligand RANKL (Xue2020The). These motifs are crucial for the structural integrity and functional activity of the protein.

The C-terminal domain of TNFRSF11A features three functional tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs)-binding motifs, identified as PFQEP 369-373 (Motif 1), PVQEET 559-564 (Motif 2), and PVQEQG 604-609 (Motif 3). These motifs are critical for activating major signaling pathways such as NF-ÐºB, JNK, ERK, p38, NFATc1, and Akt, which mediate various cellular functions including osteoclastogenesis (Xue2020The).

TNFRSF11A has multiple transcript variants, producing different protein isoforms. These variants can be affected by mutations leading to either truncated or elongated RANK proteins, which can alter the protein's function and impact the folding of the N-terminal domain and its interaction with RANKL, as well as the overall signaling capability of the protein (Xue2020The).

## Function
TNFRSF11A encodes the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK), a type I transmembrane protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. RANK plays a critical role in bone remodeling and calcium homeostasis by regulating osteoclast differentiation and activation. The interaction between RANK and its ligand, RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Ligand), triggers signaling pathways essential for the formation and function of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. This interaction promotes the recruitment of TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to the cytoplasmic domain of RANK, leading to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB), a transcription factor that regulates genes necessary for osteoclast differentiation and function (Okamoto2017Osteoimmunology:; Crockett2010New).

Additionally, RANK is involved in immune regulation. It is expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), where it supports the development and maintenance of these cells crucial for establishing T-cell tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. The RANKL-RANK interaction is vital for the proliferation and differentiation of mTECs, highlighting the importance of this pathway in both skeletal and immune system functions (Okamoto2017Osteoimmunology:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene, which encodes the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK), are associated with several bone-related diseases and conditions. These mutations can lead to abnormal bone remodeling due to altered osteoclastogenesis. Notable conditions linked to TNFRSF11A mutations include Juvenile Paget's Disease, Familial Expansile Osteolysis (FEO), Paget's disease of bone type 2 (PDB2), Expansile Skeletal Hyperphosphatasia (ESH), and Panostotic Expansile Bone Disease (PEBD) (Whyte2014Juvenile). Each of these disorders presents distinct clinical features but shares common elements such as enhanced osteoclastogenesis and rapid skeletal remodeling.

Specific mutations such as the 15-bp and 18-bp tandem duplications in TNFRSF11A are directly linked to conditions like ESH and FEO, respectively, characterized by symptoms such as early-onset deafness, premature loss of teeth, and progressive hyperostotic widening of long bones (Whyte2002Expansile). Additionally, a 27-bp duplication in exon 1 of TNFRSF11A leads to early-onset Paget's disease of bone, marked by significant skeletal abnormalities and early-onset deafness (Alonso2020Insertion).

Furthermore, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) has been associated with mutations in TNFRSF11A, where affected individuals exhibit severe symptoms including visual loss and immune system abnormalities, underscoring the gene's role in both bone remodeling and immune system function (Guerrini2008Human). These genetic alterations in TNFRSF11A disrupt normal RANKL signaling, crucial for osteoclast differentiation and function, leading to the clinical manifestations observed in these disorders.

## Interactions
TNFRSF11A, also known as RANK, interacts with various TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), which are crucial for activating downstream signaling pathways such as NF-ÎºB and JNK. Specifically, TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 have been identified as interacting partners, with TRAF2 showing the highest binding affinity to the C-terminal 85-amino acid tail of RANK. This interaction is essential for the activation of NF-ÎºB, although these TRAFs are not necessary for JNK pathway activation by RANK (Darnay1998Characterization). Additionally, RANK can self-assemble through its cytoplasmic domain, which is crucial for inducing osteoclastogenesis independently of its ligand, RANKL. This self-assembly involves specific regions within the cytoplasmic domain, and the interaction with TRAF6 is particularly significant in this process (Kanazawa2005Self-Assembled). Mutations in TNFRSF11A, particularly in the extracellular domain, can disrupt its interaction with RANKL, leading to impaired signaling through pathways such as p38 and ERK1/2, which are essential for osteoclast differentiation and function (Guerrini2008Human).
