# MT-ND3

## Overview
The MT-ND3 gene, located within the mitochondrial genome, encodes the mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 3, a vital component of Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein plays a crucial role in the initial stages of oxidative phosphorylation, where it assists in electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, facilitating the generation of ATP, which is essential for cellular energy production. The proper function of MT-ND3 is critical for maintaining the efficiency of the electron transport chain and overall mitochondrial function. Disruptions in the MT-ND3 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders due to compromised energy production, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Mao2018Genetic; Nguyen2020Deregulated).

## Function
The MT-ND3 gene encodes one of the subunits of Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a key enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme complex is crucial for the process of oxidative phosphorylation, the primary method by which energy stored in nutrients is converted into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy currency of the cell. Located in the inner membrane of mitochondria, Complex I plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by accepting electrons from NADH and transferring them to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10), initiating a chain of electron transfers that ultimately generate ATP (Mao2018Genetic; Wang2013Highly; Nguyen2020Deregulated).

The proper functioning of MT-ND3 is essential for the normal assembly and operation of Complex I. Mutations in the MT-ND3 gene can disrupt this process, leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced energy production, which can affect overall cellular health and function (Mao2018Genetic). Additionally, MT-ND3 contributes to maintaining the mitochondrial and cellular function, particularly in energy metabolism and redox balance, which are critical for preventing oxidative stress and ensuring cell viability (Wang2013Highly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-ND3 gene, which encodes one of the subunits of mitochondrial complex I, have been linked to several severe mitochondrial disorders, notably Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. These conditions are characterized by progressive neurological deterioration and can manifest in various forms depending on the specific mutation and its expression in different tissues.

One of the most studied mutations in the MT-ND3 gene is the m.10191T>C variant, which has been associated with Leigh syndrome. This mutation leads to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, disrupting normal electron transfer and proton translocation across the mitochondrial membrane, which in turn affects ATP synthesis (Cipriano2023Walking). Similarly, the m.10197G>A mutation has been linked not only to Leigh syndrome but also to Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and dystonia, illustrating the diverse clinical impact of mutations in this gene (Leng2014The).

The severity and range of symptoms associated with MT-ND3 mutations can vary widely, from organ-specific to multisystem involvement. These can include neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness, ataxia, and cognitive decline, often accompanied by lactic acidosis and brain abnormalities visible on MRI scans (Leshinsky-Silver2005Fulminant; Sarzi2006A).

These findings underscore the critical role of the MT-ND3 gene in mitochondrial function and its significant implications for human health when mutated.

## Interactions
MT-ND3, a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, is crucial for the enzyme's function in electron transfer within the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The m.10191T>C mutation in MT-ND3 results in a serine to proline substitution at position 45, disrupting a hydrophilic transmembrane alpha helix domain. This alteration is significant as it impairs the interaction between MT-ND3 and other major subunits of complex I, which is essential for the activity of this enzyme complex (Levy2013Long). The mutation leads to a 60% reduction in the assembled complex I protein, significantly affecting its functional capacity and highlighting the importance of MT-ND3 in complex I assembly and catalysis (Levy2013Long).

Furthermore, studies on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) interacting with fibroblasts carrying pathogenic variants of MT-ND3 suggest broader cellular interactions involving mitochondrial components. Although these studies do not detail direct physical interactions of MT-ND3 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids, they imply a complex interplay involving mitochondrial DNA transfer and mitochondrial function enhancement in a cellular context (Navaratnarajah2022Mesenchymal).
