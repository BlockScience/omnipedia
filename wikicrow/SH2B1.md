# SH2B1

## Overview
SH2B1 is a gene that encodes the SH2B adaptor protein 1, a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind to phosphotyrosine residues through its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, facilitating interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases and JAK kinases crucial for cellular growth, differentiation, and metabolism (McKercher2017Diversity). SH2B1 plays a significant role in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, enhancing the activity of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and influencing downstream pathways critical for insulin and leptin signaling (Maures2007SH2B1; Rui2014SH2B1). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in metabolic regulation and energy balance, making it a key player in both physiological and pathological processes.

## Structure
SH2B1 is a multifunctional adaptor protein characterized by several structural domains that facilitate its role in signal transduction. The protein contains an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which is essential for binding to phosphotyrosine residues on various receptor tyrosine kinases and JAK kinases. This domain exhibits specificity for ligands with either a hydrophobic or acidic side chain at the +3 position relative to the phosphorylated tyrosine, which is crucial for the diversity of its interactions (McKercher2017Diversity).

Additionally, SH2B1 features a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, although its exact function is not well-defined, it is implicated in the protein's interaction capabilities and cellular localization (Rui2014SH2B1). The protein also includes a dimerization domain, which facilitates either homodimerization or heterodimerization, essential for its function in signaling pathways (Flores2019Crucial).

SH2B1 undergoes alternative splicing resulting in four isoformsâSH2B1a, SH2B1b, SH2B1g, and SH2B1dâwhich share identical N-terminal regions but differ at their C-termini beyond the SH2 domain. These variations influence the specific interactions and functions of each isoform (Maures2007SH2B1).

Posttranslational modifications of SH2B1 include phosphorylation by JAK1, JAK2, and Src tyrosine kinases, which are conserved across all isoforms, affecting its interaction dynamics and functional capabilities (Rui2014SH2B1).

## Function
SH2B1 (SH2B adaptor protein 1) is a multifunctional adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in various signaling pathways crucial for cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, metabolism, and survival. It is particularly significant in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, enhancing the activity of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and facilitating the activation of downstream signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt and Ras/ERK, which are essential for metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin and other growth factors (Maures2007SH2B1; Desbuquois2013Regulation).

In the context of insulin signaling, SH2B1 enhances insulin sensitivity by interacting directly with the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 and IRS-2), promoting their phosphorylation and inhibiting their dephosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, vital for glucose metabolism (Morris2009SH2B1). SH2B1 also plays a role in leptin signaling pathways in the central nervous system, where it enhances leptin sensitivity, crucial for regulating energy balance and body weight (Rui2014SH2B1).

Additionally, SH2B1 interacts with various receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGF, GDNF receptor RET, and FGFR3, enhancing their kinase activities and subsequent signaling pathways. This interaction supports cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and cytoskeletal reorganization (Rui2014SH2B1). SH2B1's role extends to the regulation of cell signaling in response to hormones, growth factors, and cytokines, acting as an adaptor protein that enhances the catalytic activity of enzymes it binds, thereby influencing various physiological processes including glucose metabolism and energy balance (Rui2014SH2B1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SH2B1 gene are strongly associated with severe obesity and related metabolic disorders. Loss-of-function variants, such as p.(Val345Met) and p.(Arg630Gln), have been identified in individuals with severe obesity, indicating a critical role of SH2B1 in energy and glucose homeostasis (da2022SH2B1). Additionally, SH2B1 mutations are linked to non-syndromic monogenic obesity, further underscoring its importance in metabolic regulation (da2022SH2B1).

Beyond metabolic disturbances, SH2B1 alterations are implicated in neurobehavioral abnormalities. For instance, chromosomal deletions involving SH2B1 are associated with cognitive deficits, developmental delays, and autism spectrum disorders (Rui2014SH2B1). These findings highlight the gene's broader impact on both physiological and neurological functions.

In the context of liver health, the SH2B1 rs7359397 polymorphism has been associated with the severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diseases often related to obesity and insulin resistance (Perez-Diaz-del-Campo2020Association).

Furthermore, SH2B1 mutations contribute to severe leptin resistance, hyperphagia, and insulin resistance, which are characteristic features of metabolic syndrome (Ren2005Identification). These diverse associations between SH2B1 mutations and various health conditions underscore the gene's crucial role in human health and disease.

## Interactions
SH2B1 interacts with a variety of proteins through its SH2 domain and other regions, influencing multiple signaling pathways and cellular processes. It binds to tyrosyl phosphorylated PDGF receptors, enhancing PDGF-BB stimulated phosphorylation of SH2B1. Additionally, SH2B1 interacts with the GDNF receptor RET, increasing RET kinase activity and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3. It also binds to FGFR3 at specific phospho-tyrosine residues, enhancing FGFR3's ability to phosphorylate and activate STAT5 (Rui2014SH2B1). 

SH2B1 forms homo- or hetero-dimers via its N-terminal dimerization domains and interacts with various proteins through its SH2 and PH domains. The C-terminal SH2 domains of SH2B1 bind to tyrosyl phosphorylated proteins such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), TrkA, insulin receptors, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors, and insulin receptor substrates IRS1 and IRS2. These interactions enhance signaling pathways, including leptin and insulin signaling (Rui2014SH2B1).

Furthermore, SH2B1 interacts physically with IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins, as demonstrated in experiments where SH2B1 was coexpressed with these proteins in cells. The interaction between SH2B1 and IRS-1 was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays, indicating that SH2B1 binds to IRS-1 and inhibits its dephosphorylation by phosphatases (Morris2009SH2B1). 

SH2B1 also interacts with the insulin receptor through its SH2 domain, specifically binding to Tyr 1158 within the activation loop of the insulin receptor. This interaction is crucial for the stimulation of the insulin receptor's catalytic activity (Morris2009SH2B1).
