# KHDRBS1

## Overview
KHDRBS1, also known as Sam68, is a gene that encodes the KH RNA binding domain containing, signal transduction associated 1 protein, a member of the STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) family of proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism, including RNA binding and the regulation of alternative splicing events. Sam68, the protein encoded by KHDRBS1, is characterized by its KH domain which is crucial for its RNA-binding capability and is involved in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and tumorigenesis. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which affects its interaction with other proteins and RNA, thereby influencing cellular signaling pathways and gene expression (Lukong2003Sam68).

## Function
KHDRBS1, also known as Sam68, is a protein encoded by the KHDRBS1 gene and is a member of the STAR family of RNA-binding proteins. It plays a crucial role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells, primarily related to RNA binding and protein interactions. The protein contains a KH domain essential for RNA binding and homo-oligomerization, which is disrupted by tyrosine phosphorylation (Lukong2003Sam68). Sam68's interaction with RNA is crucial in its nonphosphorylated state, and it contains multiple proline-rich motifs outside its GSG domain, serving as binding sites for SH3 and WW domain-containing proteins (Lukong2003Sam68).

Sam68 is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly influencing the transition from G1 to S phase, and plays a role in signal transduction pathways activated by insulin and leptin (Lukong2003Sam68). Additionally, it is implicated in RNA metabolism, where its phosphorylation state and the integrity of its KH domain affect its function (Lukong2003Sam68). Sam68 also interacts with other proteins in nuclear bodies called Sam68/SLM nuclear bodies (SNBs), which are involved in RNA metabolism, suggesting a role in the nuclear organization and possibly in RNA processing (Lukong2003Sam68).

## Clinical Significance
KHDRBS1, also known as Sam68, has been implicated in various cancers and other medical conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KHDRBS1 is significantly overexpressed and correlates with enhanced malignant characteristics such as increased proliferation and invasion, as well as resistance to the drug sorafenib, suggesting a role in drug resistance (Fan2024KHDRBS1). Similarly, in colon cancer, Sam68 is crucial for the genotoxic stress-initiated nuclear signaling pathway that activates NF-kB, a key factor in cellular responses to DNA damage. Deficiency in Sam68 leads to increased susceptibility to apoptosis under genotoxic stress, indicating its protective role in colon cancer survival (Fu2016Sam68/KHDRBS1).

In the context of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a heterozygous variant of KHDRBS1 has been identified that causes defects in mRNA splicing related to DNA replication and repair, suggesting a mechanism by which KHDRBS1 mutations could lead to POI (wang2017sequence). Additionally, KHDRBS1 expression levels vary significantly among different cancers, with higher levels associated with poorer patient survival in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in specific cancer types (Sumithra2019A).

## Interactions
KHDRBS1, also known as Sam68, engages in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a critical role in cellular signaling and RNA metabolism. Sam68 acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the interaction between PLCg1 and the Src-related kinase Fyn, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase. This interaction is notably enhanced by a truncated form of the tyrosine kinase receptor c-KIT in prostate cancer (Bielli2011The). Additionally, Sam68 interacts with the breast tumor kinase BRK in breast cancer cells, where BRK phosphorylates Sam68, affecting its subcellular localization and RNA-binding activity (Bielli2011The).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, Sam68 interacts with the transcriptional cofactor CBP, inhibiting CBP-dependent gene transcription through competition with coregulators for CBP binding (Bielli2011The). Furthermore, Sam68 binds to the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells, enhancing AR's transcriptional activity and influencing cyclin D1-mediated feedback control of AR activity (Bielli2011The).

Sam68 also plays a significant role in alternative splicing, interacting with general splicing factor U2AF65 and the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, binding to an intronic regulatory element in the b-tropomyosin pre-mRNA (Bielli2011The). Its involvement in splicing is enhanced by phosphorylation through the MAPK/ERK pathway, leading to increased binding to exon v5 of the CD44 pre-mRNA and enhanced interaction with the U5 snRNP and the chromatin remodeling protein Brm (Bielli2011The). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of Sam68 in linking signaling pathways with RNA processing events, influencing cell proliferation and cancer progression.
