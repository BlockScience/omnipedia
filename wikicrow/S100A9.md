# S100A9

## Overview
S100A9 is a gene that encodes the protein S100 calcium binding protein A9, a member of the S100 family of proteins known for their role in calcium signal transduction and regulation of a variety of cellular processes. The protein, often referred to simply as S100A9, plays a critical role in the immune response and inflammation, primarily through its formation of a heterodimer with S100A8, also known as calprotectin. This complex is involved in various cellular functions including chemotaxis, leukocyte recruitment, and adhesion, and has been implicated in numerous inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. S100A9 is not only a key player in the immune system but also serves as a potential biomarker for various cancers and inflammatory conditions, making it a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Sreejit2020S100; Hermani2005Calcium-Binding).

## Structure
S100A9, also known as MRP14, is a protein characterized by its two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures crucial for its function. The primary structure of S100A9 includes 113 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 13.2 kDa. Notably, there is a truncated isoform, S100A9*, which is shorter by the first four N-terminal amino acids due to alternative translation, resulting in a molecular weight of 12.7 kDa (Pruenster2016S100A8/A9:; Vogl2012Pro-Inflammatory).

The secondary structure of S100A9 is composed of four alpha-helices, which are involved in forming the EF-hand motifs. These motifs include a canonical Ca2+-binding loop between helices III and IV, and a pseudo EF-hand loop between helices I and II (Itou2002The; KorndÃ¶rfer2007The). The tertiary structure reveals that each monomer contains two calcium-binding helix-loop-helix motifs forming a globular monomer (PrÃ¶pper1999Analysis).

In terms of quaternary structure, S100A9 can homodimerize and also forms a heterodimer with S100A8. This interaction is enhanced in the presence of calcium, leading to the formation of a (S100A8/S100A9)2 heterotetramer, which is speculated to be biologically active (Vogl2012Pro-Inflammatory; KorndÃ¶rfer2007The).

Post-translational modifications of S100A9 include phosphorylation at Thr113, which is regulated by calcium ionophores like ionomycin and influences the protein's calcium affinity and function (Nacken2003S100A9/S100A8:). Additionally, the N-terminal methionine can be removed, and acetylation can occur at threonine at position 2 or serine at position 6 (Nacken2003S100A9/S100A8:).

## Function
S100A9, a member of the S100 protein family, is involved in various cellular functions crucial for maintaining homeostasis and responding to stress and damage in human cells. It is constitutively expressed in neutrophils and monocytes, where it comprises a significant portion of the cytoplasmic proteins, particularly in neutrophils (Sreejit2020S100). S100A9 forms a complex with S100A8, known as calprotectin, which plays a pivotal role in the immune response and inflammation. This complex is involved in processes such as chemotaxis, leukocyte recruitment, and adhesion, crucial for the migration of these cells through endothelial layers during inflammatory responses (Sreejit2020S100).

Intracellularly, the S100A8/A9 complex acts as a Ca2+ sensor, undergoing conformational changes that affect Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways, essential for cell migration, phagocytosis, and exocytosis (Wang2018S100A8/A9). The complex also interacts with cytoskeletal proteins, influencing the dynamics of microtubules and microfilaments, which are critical for the cellular response during immune activation (Wang2018S100A8/A9).

Moreover, S100A9 is involved in the modulation of inflammatory processes by affecting the transcription of chemokines and adhesion molecules, playing a role in the pathobiology of various inflammatory diseases (Sreejit2020S100). It also has antimicrobial properties, notably through its ability to bind and sequester zinc and manganese, essential for inhibiting the growth and virulence of pathogens (Sreejit2020S100). These functions highlight the critical role of S100A9 in immune regulation and response, underlining its importance in both health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
S100A9, also known as calgranulin B, is implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In the context of cancer, S100A9 is significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer, particularly in advanced stages and high-grade tumors, correlating with poor prognosis and survival rates (Zhao2020S100A9). Similarly, elevated S100A9 levels are observed in prostate cancer, where it serves as a potential diagnostic marker distinguishing from benign conditions even when traditional markers like PSA are inconclusive (Hermani2005Calcium-Binding). In inflammatory conditions, S100A9, forming a complex with S100A8, plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response, particularly in myeloid cells. Its upregulation is noted in various inflammatory diseases, contributing to increased serum levels and influencing disease progression (Manitz2003Loss). Moreover, alterations in S100A9 expression are linked to poor differentiation in several carcinomas, including breast, lung, and thyroid cancers, suggesting its role in tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential (Gunaldi2015Diagnostic). The gene's involvement in these diverse pathological conditions highlights its clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic intervention and as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis assessment in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
S100A9, also known as calgranulin B, engages in various significant protein-protein interactions that influence both cellular and immune responses. It forms a complex with S100A8, and this heterodimer, known as calprotectin, is crucial in inflammatory processes and immune responses (PrÃ¶pper1999Analysis). S100A9 also interacts with Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptides, such as Ab1-40, Ab12-24, and Ab1-42. This interaction initiates at the hinge region between helices H2 and H3 of S100A9, promoting amyloid aggregation and potentially altering the cytotoxicity associated with S100A9 dimers (Zhang2012MRP14).

Additionally, S100A9 has been identified as a novel ligand for the CD85j receptor, which plays a role in modulating the anti-HIV-1 activity of human NK cells. The interaction between S100A9 and CD85j influences cytokine production, notably TNF-Î±, by NK cells following activation by target cells (Arnold2013S100A9). Furthermore, S100A9 interacts with the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), facilitating cell proliferation and signaling pathways involved in inflammation and tumor growth. This interaction can be inhibited by S100A12, which binds to S100A9 and blocks its interaction with RAGE's V domain, offering potential therapeutic implications in cancer treatment (Katte2018Blocking). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of S100A9 in cellular signaling and immune function.
