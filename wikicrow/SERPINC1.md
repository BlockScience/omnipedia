# SERPINC1

## Overview
SERPINC1 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein antithrombin, also known as serpin family C member 1. This protein is a critical inhibitor of serine proteases in the coagulation system, playing a vital role in regulating blood clot formation and thus preventing thrombosis. Antithrombin inhibits several key enzymes involved in coagulation, including thrombin and factor Xa. The activity of antithrombin is significantly enhanced by the binding of heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, which alters its conformation and increases its inhibitory efficiency. Mutations in the SERPINC1 gene can lead to antithrombin deficiency, which is associated with an increased risk of developing blood clots (Ruf2024SERPINC1; Zhang2020Novel). The gene and its encoded protein are therefore crucial in the maintenance of hemostatic balance and vascular health.

## Structure
The SERPINC1 gene encodes the antithrombin protein, a crucial component in the regulation of blood coagulation. The primary structure of antithrombin consists of a 32 amino acid signal peptide and a 432 amino acid mature protein. This protein undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including the formation of three intramolecular disulfide bonds and N-glycosylation, which are essential for its proper folding and function (Wang2023Identification; Corral2018The).

The secondary structure of the SERPINC1 protein features three beta-folds (A-C) and nine alpha-helices (A-I), which are typical of the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors (Wang2023Identification; Mulder2017SERPINC1). The tertiary structure includes a reactive center loop (RCL) that is crucial for its function as a serine protease inhibitor. This loop undergoes a conformational change upon cleavage by target proteases, which is essential for the inhibitory mechanism of antithrombin (Corral2018The).

Antithrombin also contains specific functional domains such as the heparin-binding site, which is crucial for enhancing its anticoagulant activity. This site interacts with heparin or heparan sulfate-type glycosaminoglycans, significantly increasing the protein's activity (Wang2023Identification; Tamura2019Molecular). The protein's structure and function can be altered by mutations, which may lead to antithrombin deficiency, affecting its ability to inhibit coagulation effectively (Wang2023Identification).

## Function
The SERPINC1 gene encodes antithrombin (AT), a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of blood coagulation. Antithrombin is a serine protease inhibitor, primarily inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa, which are key enzymes in the blood clotting process. By inhibiting these enzymes, antithrombin prevents the excessive formation of blood clots, thereby maintaining blood fluidity and preventing thrombosis (Ruf2024SERPINC1; Wang2023Identification; Tamura2019Molecular).

Antithrombin is synthesized in the liver as a precursor protein, which undergoes post-translational modifications such as cleavage of a signal peptide and glycosylation. These modifications are crucial for its proper folding and function (Tamura2019Molecular). The mature protein circulates in the bloodstream with relatively low anticoagulant activity under normal conditions. However, its activity can be significantly enhanced by the binding of heparin or heparin-like glycosaminoglycans, which induce conformational changes that accelerate the inhibition of thrombin and other coagulation factors (Tamura2019Molecular).

Mutations in the SERPINC1 gene can lead to antithrombin deficiency, which significantly increases the risk of developing thrombosis. This condition underscores the essential role of antithrombin in controlling blood coagulation and maintaining vascular health (Ruf2024SERPINC1; Zhang2020Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERPINC1 gene, which encodes antithrombin (AT), are primarily associated with antithrombin deficiency, a condition that significantly increases the risk of thrombosis. This deficiency is categorized into Type I, characterized by a quantitative deficiency of AT, and Type II, which involves functional defects. Type II is further subdivided based on the specific functional defect affected, such as the reactive site, heparin binding site, or pleiotropic effects (MARTÃNEZâMARTÃNEZ2012Type; Kovac2019The).

Clinical manifestations linked to SERPINC1 mutations include venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). Certain mutations in SERPINC1, such as those found in a hotspot involving residues 294 and 295, have been shown to increase the risk of VTE significantly without affecting the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin under standard laboratory conditions (Zeng2017Recurrent). This suggests that these mutations may impair the anticoagulant capacity of the hemostatic system, leading to increased thrombin generation and a heightened risk of thrombosis (Zeng2017Recurrent).

Furthermore, SERPINC1 gene analysis is particularly important in cases of atypical ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), especially when antithrombin activity is low, as pathogenic variants have shown a significant association with these conditions (Kim2022Utility). This highlights the critical role of SERPINC1 in various thrombotic events and conditions, underscoring the importance of genetic testing in individuals with a history of thrombosis or atypical thrombotic presentations.

## Interactions
SERPINC1, encoding antithrombin (AT), interacts with various proteins primarily through its reactive center loop (RCL) and heparin-binding sites. The RCL is crucial for inhibiting proteases by binding to the substrate-binding groove of serine proteases, leading to the formation of stable AT-thrombin complexes, thereby inhibiting thrombin activity (Wang2023Identification). Additionally, the heparin-binding sites on AT, particularly on the basic D helix, bind to pentameric polysaccharides in heparin, facilitating tight interactions that enhance AT's anticoagulant activity through allosteric activation and bridging mechanisms (Gettins2016Inhibitory; Wang2023Identification).

AT also interacts with other coagulation factors such as IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa, effectively inactivating these enzymes and preventing further coagulation (Wang2023Identification). The interaction of AT with these factors is significantly enhanced in the presence of high-affinity heparin, amplifying its anticoagulant activity (Wang2023Identification). Mutations in SERPINC1 can disrupt these interactions, leading to antithrombin deficiency and an increased risk of thrombosis (Wang2023Identification).
