# FAM83H

## Overview
FAM83H, or Family with Sequence Similarity 83 Member H, is a gene located on chromosome 8 in humans that encodes a protein belonging to the FAM83 protein family. This protein family is characterized by a conserved domain known as DUF1669, which includes a pseudo-phospholipase D motif, although it lacks catalytic activity, suggesting a role as a pseudoenzyme (Bozatzi2018The). The FAM83H protein itself plays a critical role in the regulation of keratinization in epithelial cells, essential for forming the skin's protective outer layer (Barr2019Long). It is also involved in various cellular signaling pathways, including interactions with Î²-catenin in the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, which influences cell growth and differentiation (Zhou2022LncRNA; Kim2019FAM83H). The protein's interaction with casein kinase 1 suggests its function as a scaffold protein, facilitating the localization and function of this kinase in cellular processes (Wang2015Fam83h).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the FAM83H protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain known as DUF1669, which includes a pseudo-phospholipase D (PLD) catalytic motif. This motif, however, lacks essential elements for actual catalytic activity, rendering the FAM83 proteins as pseudoenzymes (Bozatzi2018The). The primary structure of FAM83H lacks well-defined structural characteristics or known functional domains, except for the mentioned PLD-like domain, suggesting a conserved secondary structure and similar three-dimensional fold (Wang2015Fam83h).

Specifically, within the first 287 amino acids of FAM83H, there is a crucial sequence motif, F270-X-X-X-F274-X-X-X-F278, which is essential for its interaction with casein kinase 1 (CK1) (Wang2015Fam83h). This interaction is significant as it suggests that FAM83H functions as a scaffold protein, potentially bringing CK1 to its physiological locations (Wang2015Fam83h).

The C-terminal regions of FAM83H are described as non-globular and disordered, which suggests variability and potential for diverse interactions or functions (Bozatzi2018The). However, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FAM83H is not provided in the available literature. Additionally, there is no mention of prominent folds, common post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of FAM83H in the provided excerpts.

## Function
FAM83H, or Family with Sequence Similarity 83 Member H, plays a crucial role in the regulation of keratinization in epithelial cells, which is essential for the formation of the protective outer layer of the skin (Barr2019Long). This gene is also involved in the organization of the keratin cytoskeleton, maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues (Barr2019Long). Beyond its structural roles, FAM83H is implicated in several key cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with Î²-catenin, a central protein in the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, which is vital for various cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation. FAM83H stabilizes Î²-catenin by protecting it from proteasomal degradation, thus influencing the activation of this signaling pathway (Zhou2022LncRNA; Kim2019FAM83H). The protein's activity in these pathways indicates its role in maintaining cell structure and function, as well as its involvement in cellular junctions. These molecular activities and interactions underscore the importance of FAM83H in normal physiological processes and its potential implications in pathological conditions when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM83H gene are primarily linked to autosomal dominant hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta (ADHCAI), a genetic disorder that affects dental enamel formation, leading to enamel that is soft, thin, and prone to rapid abrasion after tooth eruption. The condition is characterized by yellowish-brown discolored enamel that exhibits reduced mineral density and increased sensitivity (Sriwattanapong2021Ageârelated; Lee2010FAM83H). The mutations responsible for ADHCAI are typically truncation mutations, such as nonsense mutations or frameshifts, which occur in the last coding exon of the FAM83H gene. These mutations result in the production of a truncated protein that does not merely cause a loss of function but likely exerts a dominant negative effect or a gain-of-function, contributing to the disease phenotype (Wang2019The; Wang2015Fam83h).

Research has shown that these truncation mutations lead to altered intracellular localization of the FAM83H protein, with mutant proteins showing abnormal localization patterns that may disrupt normal cellular functions and contribute to the enamel defects observed in ADHCAI (Lee2010FAM83H). Additionally, the phenotypic expression of ADHCAI can vary with age, and specific mutations have been linked to distinct clinical manifestations, suggesting a complex interaction between the genotype and the resulting phenotype (Sriwattanapong2021Ageârelated; Wright2009Phenotypic).

## Interactions
FAM83H interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as keratin filament organization and signaling pathways. It binds to casein kinase IÎ± (CK-1Î±) through a specific motif in its N-terminal region, which is crucial for recruiting CK-1Î± to keratin filaments in epithelial cells. This interaction is essential for the dynamic rearrangement of keratin filaments, impacting cell migration and polarization, particularly in colorectal cancer cells (Kuga2013A). Additionally, FAM83H interacts with keratins, specifically keratin subtypes 18 and 19, as confirmed by proteomic analysis and immunoprecipitation studies (Kuga2013A).

FAM83H also plays a role in the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway by interacting with Î²-catenin. This interaction protects Î²-catenin from proteasomal degradation, thereby influencing the pathway's activation, which is significant in the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Zhou2022LncRNA).

Moreover, FAM83H interacts with the protein SON, involved in the recruitment of CK1Î± to nuclear speckles. This interaction suggests a role for FAM83H in RNA processing and subcellular localization dynamics (Kuga2016Casein). These interactions underline the multifunctional role of FAM83H in cellular signaling and structural organization, impacting various biological processes and disease mechanisms.
