# CCDC188

## Overview
CCDC188, or Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 188, is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 188, which is implicated in various biological processes and diseases, although its specific functions and mechanisms are not fully understood. The protein is not yet categorized into a specific family such as kinases or receptors due to limited information on its molecular function. Research has suggested its involvement in conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa and potentially in the pathology of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, indicating its relevance in both genetic disorders and cancer (Yi2020Comparative; Zhang2023Comprehensive). Despite its emerging clinical significance, the precise roles of the CCDC188 protein in cellular processes and disease mechanisms remain to be elucidated, highlighting the need for further investigation into its biological activities and interactions (Yi2020Comparative).

## Function
CCDC188, or Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 188, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in human biology, but specific details about its function in healthy human cells are not well-documented. Recent studies have identified CCDC188 as a candidate gene associated with retinitis pigmentosa, a form of inherited retinal degeneration, suggesting its potential involvement in retinal health or disease (Yi2020Comparative). However, the molecular functions and activities of the CCDC188 protein in normal cellular processes remain unclear. Research indicates that there is a significant gap in understanding the role of CCDC188, as it is described as a newly characterized gene with little known about its functions (Yi2020Comparative). Additionally, CCDC188 has been included in a risk score model for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hinting at its possible relevance in cancer biology, although its direct functions in healthy or cancerous cells have not been detailed (Zhang2023Comprehensive).

In summary, while CCDC188 is implicated in important health conditions and potentially in cancer risk assessment, the precise molecular processes and cellular roles of the CCDC188 protein in normal human physiology are yet to be fully elucidated. Further research is necessary to uncover the specific activities and functional mechanisms of CCDC188 in healthy cells.

## Interactions
CCDC188, or Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 188, has been identified in various studies as interacting with other proteins, although specific details about these interactions are often limited. In the context of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, CCDC188 is negatively correlated with the MET protein, suggesting an antagonistic or inhibitory interaction between these two proteins (Zhou2024Identification). This interaction implies a potential regulatory role of CCDC188 in cellular pathways involving MET, which is known for its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis.

Additionally, CCDC188 has been implicated in the genetic context of retinitis pigmentosa, where it is one of the genes identified with loss-of-function variants. However, the specific interactions of CCDC188 in this disease context remain uncharacterized, indicating a need for further research to elucidate its role and interactions in retinal degenerative processes (Yi2020Comparative).

Overall, while CCDC188 is recognized in the interaction networks of diseases like pancreatic adenocarcinoma and retinitis pigmentosa, the detailed mechanisms of its interactions and the full scope of its involvement in these diseases require more comprehensive investigation.
