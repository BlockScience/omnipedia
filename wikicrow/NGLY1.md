# NGLY1

## Overview
NGLY1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme N-glycanase 1, which is crucial for the deglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins in the cytosol. This enzyme is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a critical process for maintaining cellular protein quality by targeting misfolded proteins for degradation. N-glycanase 1, a cytosolic peptidase, facilitates the removal of N-linked glycans from glycoproteins, converting glycosylated asparagine residues into aspartates and thereby promoting the degradation of these proteins via the proteasome system (Suzuki2016The; Pandey2022NGLY1). The protein encoded by NGLY1 is also implicated in various cellular processes beyond protein degradation, including mitochondrial homeostasis and inflammation regulation, highlighting its multifunctional role in cellular physiology (Yang2018N-glycanase).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the NGLY1 protein is characterized by several distinct domains essential for its function. The N-terminal PUB domain (aa 19-109) consists of a bundle of five Î±-helices and three parallel Î²-sheets, primarily involved in protein-protein interactions rather than catalytic activity (Miao2022Comprehensive). The central transglutaminase-like core domain includes a catalytic triad of Cys, His, and Asp, crucial for its enzymatic function in breaking the Î²-aspartyl-glycosyl-amine linkage in N-glycoproteins. This domain also contains a zinc-binding motif and a RAD23/HR23 binding motif, indicating its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and possibly in nucleotide excision repair (Miao2022Comprehensive). The C-terminal PAW domain, characterized by a Î²-sandwich architecture, binds to the mannose moieties of N-linked oligosaccharides, enhancing the affinity of NGLY1 for N-glycans (Miao2022Comprehensive).

The protein structure also includes regions that bind divalent metal ions like Zn2+, Mg2+, Co2+, and Cu2+, which are crucial for the enzymatic activity of NGLY1 (Miao2022Comprehensive). Additionally, an intrinsically disordered region between the PUB and transglutaminase-like domains contains a phosphorylation hotspot at Thr137, which has been confirmed through phosphoproteome analysis, suggesting its importance in NGLY1's function (Miao2022Comprehensive). 

Alternative splicing of NGLY1 results in different isoforms with variations in these domains, affecting their function in the ER-associated degradation pathway (Miao2022Comprehensive).

## Function
NGLY1 (N-glycanase 1) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway by removing N-linked glycans from misfolded N-glycoproteins. This deglycosylation process is essential for maintaining protein quality control within eukaryotic cells, as it facilitates the degradation of proteins that fail to fold properly within the endoplasmic reticulum (Suzuki2016The; Pandey2022NGLY1). The enzyme operates by converting N-glycosylated asparagine residues into aspartates, releasing free, unconjugated N-glycans, which are then targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasomes (Mueller2020Loss; Suzuki2016The).

Beyond its role in protein degradation, NGLY1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis and inflammation through its interaction with transcription factors such as NRF1. NRF1, which is also a substrate of NGLY1, requires deglycosylation by NGLY1 for its activation. Once activated, NRF1 can translocate to the nucleus and drive the expression of proteasome subunit genes, crucial for the proteasome 'bounce-back' mechanism in response to proteotoxic stress (Yang2018N-glycanase).

NGLY1 deficiency impacts multiple cellular processes, including mitochondrial homeostasis and inflammation. Specifically, it impairs mitophagy, the process by which damaged mitochondria are cleared from the cell, leading to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and affecting cellular health (Yang2018N-glycanase). This mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger chronic inflammation characterized by the upregulation of type I interferon signaling (Yang2018N-glycanase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NGLY1 gene are linked to a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as NGLY1 deficiency. This condition manifests with a spectrum of severe symptoms including developmental delay, hypotonia, movement disorders, seizures, microcephaly, liver dysfunction, and eye problems such as alacrima and strabismus (Heeley2015Multiâsystemic; Tong2023NGLY1). The disorder was first identified through whole exome sequencing in a patient initially suspected to have a congenital disorder of glycosylation (Heeley2015Multiâsystemic).

NGLY1 deficiency is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins due to the defective cleavage of N-linked oligosaccharides from these proteins, which is normally facilitated by the enzyme N-glycanase 1 encoded by NGLY1 (Dabaj2021NGLY1). The clinical phenotype includes a range of neurological and systemic complications, confirmed through various case studies and genetic analyses that identified pathogenic variants in the NGLY1 gene (Stanclift2022NGLY1; Dabaj2021NGLY1).

Diagnosis of NGLY1 deficiency involves genetic testing along with clinical examination to identify key features, particularly (hypo)alacrima, with management focusing on symptomatic relief and supportive care, as there are no approved treatments (Tong2023NGLY1). The identification of novel mutations and their pathogenic impacts continues to enhance understanding of this complex disorder (Heeley2015Multiâsystemic).

## Interactions
NGLY1 interacts with various proteins through its distinct domains, each contributing to its functional role in cellular processes. The PUB domain at the N-terminal of NGLY1 binds to the adaptor protein p97 (also known as VCP or Cdc48), which is located on the outer endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This interaction provides a molecular platform for NGLY1 to facilitate the de-glycosylation of retro-translocated misfolded or unassembled proteins. Additionally, the PUB domain can interact with other proteins involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, such as DERL1 (Miao2022Comprehensive). 

The central transglutaminase-like core domain of NGLY1, which contains a zinc-binding motif and a RAD23/HR23 binding motif, is crucial for its enzymatic function. This domain enables NGLY1 to hydrolyze the Î²-aspartyl-glycosylamine linkage in N-glycoproteins. Furthermore, the RAD23/HR23 binding motif allows NGLY1 to interact with Rad23, which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway (Miao2022Comprehensive).

NGLY1 also binds tightly to the VCP/p97 component of the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex via its N-terminal PUB domain, enhancing the efficiency of the ERAD process (Suzuki2014The). These interactions highlight the role of NGLY1 in protein quality control and DNA repair processes, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
