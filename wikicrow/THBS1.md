# THBS1

## Overview
THBS1 is a gene that encodes the protein thrombospondin-1, a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in various biological processes including angiogenesis, wound healing, and the regulation of cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. Thrombospondin-1 is primarily known for its involvement in the vascular system, where it functions as a major component of platelet Î±-granules and acts as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. The protein is characterized by a complex structure with multiple domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins and cellular components, influencing cellular behavior and tissue remodeling. Due to its significant role in physiological and pathological processes, THBS1 and its encoded protein are important in clinical contexts, such as cancer progression, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular diseases (Carlson2008Thrombospondins:; McLaughlin2005Thrombin).

## Structure
Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) is a complex, multimodular glycoprotein characterized by a variety of structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein's architecture includes an N-terminal domain (THBS-N), which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and features a globular beta-sandwich configuration with 13 antiparallel beta-strands and six alpha-helices. This domain is known for its ability to bind to various ligands and receptors, facilitated by its structured surfaces and specific residues (Carlson2008Thrombospondins:).

THBS1 also contains thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), which are significant for their role in cell attachment, angiogenesis inhibition, and protein interactions. Each TSR is characterized by a conserved pattern of amino acids and structural motifs, including a three-stranded anti-parallel structure stabilized by Arg-Trp stacking and disulfide bonds (Carlson2008Thrombospondins:).

The signature domain of THBS1 is another critical feature, comprising epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a calcium-binding wire, and a lectin-like module. This domain's structure is influenced by calcium, which can alter the accessibility of binding sites and affect the protein's stability (Carlson2008Thrombospondins:).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation play essential roles in the stability and function of THBS1. Specific glycosylation processes, including C-mannosylation and O-fucosylation, are critical for protein maturation and secretion (Carlson2008Thrombospondins:).

Overall, the structure of THBS1 is integral to its function in various biological processes, with each domain contributing to the protein's ability to interact with other molecules and mediate cellular activities.

## Function
Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) is a multifunctional glycoprotein extensively involved in the regulation of cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions, crucial for maintaining vascular system integrity and facilitating tissue repair. THBS1 is predominantly expressed in the extracellular matrix and is a major component of platelet Î±-granules, influencing various physiological processes such as platelet activation, angiogenesis, and wound healing (McLaughlin2005Thrombin). 

In the context of angiogenesis, THBS1 acts as a potent inhibitor, regulating the formation of new blood vessels, which is essential during both physiological and pathological processes. This inhibitory function on angiogenesis is mediated through its interaction with various cellular receptors and signaling pathways, impacting endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Jayachandran2014Thrombospondin; Feng2015miR-487b).

Moreover, THBS1 is involved in the activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a key factor in immune modulation and a promoter of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in certain pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis (Jayachandran2014Thrombospondin). The protein's ability to modulate cellular adhesion and its involvement in the signaling pathways that regulate cell morphology and motility underscore its critical role in tissue genesis and remodeling (Jayachandran2014Thrombospondin). 

Overall, THBS1 is integral to maintaining cellular and tissue structure and function, particularly within the vascular and immune systems.

## Clinical Significance
THBS1 (thrombospondin 1) mutations and alterations in its expression have been implicated in a variety of diseases and conditions. In diabetic retinopathy, hypomethylation of the THBS1 gene, particularly at specific CpG sites, leads to overexpression of THBS1, which is associated with neovascularization and vascular abnormalities (Li2022Genetic). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, THBS1 is overexpressed, particularly in cases with liver metastasis, and this overexpression correlates with poor patient prognosis and survival, indicating its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Liu2020THBS1). THBS1 also plays a role in acute myeloid leukemia, where its expression levels are linked to patient survival rates and treatment outcomes, particularly in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Zhu2020THBS1).

Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms in THBS1 have been associated with various conditions. For instance, certain SNPs in THBS1 are linked to the development of dry eye following refractive surgery (Contreras-Ruiz2014Polymorphism). Additionally, THBS1 polymorphisms have been studied in relation to autism, where specific variants are suggested to contribute to the risk of developing the condition (Lu2014Common). These findings underscore the clinical significance of THBS1 in a range of pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention and as a biomarker for disease prognosis.

## Interactions
THBS1 (thrombospondin-1) engages in several critical physical interactions with other proteins, which are essential for its function in various physiological and pathological processes. One of the primary interactions is with integrins, such as ITGB1 (integrin beta 1) and ITGA3 (integrin alpha 3), which are crucial for cell migration and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved in tissue remodeling and cancer invasion (Pal2016THBS1). THBS1 also binds to CD36, a membrane signal receptor, playing a significant role in the regulation of cytotrophoblast cells fusion during placentation (Duan2021THBS1).

Additionally, THBS1 can activate latent TGFB1 (transforming growth factor-beta 1) through direct physical interaction, which is vital for the positive feedback loop enhancing the expression and activity of both THBS1 and TGFB1 in the tumor microenvironment (Pal2016THBS1). This interaction promotes cancer invasion and affects tissue remodeling. In the context of breast cancer, THBS1 is transcriptionally activated by the YAP protein, part of the Hippo signaling pathway, leading to the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is essential for cell invasion (Shen2018Hippo). These interactions underscore the multifunctional nature of THBS1 in modulating cellular responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.
