# NFKBIA

## Overview
The NFKBIA gene is responsible for encoding the protein IÎºBÎ±, which serves as an inhibitor of the NF-ÎºB transcription factor, a pivotal regulator of immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. The gene and its protein product are integral to the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, where IÎºBÎ± binds to NF-ÎºB in the cytoplasm, preventing its entry into the nucleus and subsequent activation of inflammatory and immune genes. This inhibition is relieved through the phosphorylation and degradation of IÎºBÎ± in response to various stimuli, such as cytokines or pathogens, allowing NF-ÎºB to translocate to the nucleus and initiate gene transcription. The regulation of this pathway is crucial for controlling inflammatory responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Mutations in NFKBIA can lead to altered immune responses and are linked to various immunodeficiency syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance (Ali2013Functional; Hayden2004Signaling).

## Structure
IÎºBÎ±, encoded by the NFKBIA gene, is a protein that plays a crucial role in inhibiting the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. The primary structure of IÎºBÎ± includes an N-terminal signal-receiving domain, followed by an ankyrin repeat domain, and a C-terminal proline-glutamic-serine-threonine (PEST) sequence, along with two nuclear export sequences (Chear2022A). The ankyrin repeat domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, which are common in signaling pathways (Chear2022A; Espinosa2021NF-ÎºB-Dependent).

Post-translational modifications of IÎºBÎ± are critical for its function and regulation. These include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which are essential for the activation and subsequent degradation of the protein, allowing NF-ÎºB to translocate to the nucleus and activate target genes (Chear2022A). Specific mutations, such as Ser32Cys, can alter these modifications by causing the loss of a phosphorylation site and the gain of a sumoylation site, impacting the protein's stability and function (Chear2022A).

The context does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of IÎºBÎ±, nor does it mention any splice variant isoforms. Therefore, these aspects cannot be discussed based on the available information.

## Function
The NFKBIA gene encodes the IÎºBÎ± protein, which plays a pivotal role in regulating the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, a key mediator of immune response and inflammation in human cells. IÎºBÎ± functions primarily by inhibiting the activity of NF-ÎºB, a transcription factor involved in the expression of genes that control inflammation, immune response, and cell survival. Under normal conditions, IÎºBÎ± binds to NF-ÎºB in the cytoplasm, masking its nuclear localization signals and preventing its translocation to the nucleus where it would activate target genes (Ali2013Functional; Yang2022Elevated).

Upon stimulation by various signals such as cytokines or pathogens, IÎºBÎ± is phosphorylated and subsequently degraded, freeing NF-ÎºB to enter the nucleus and initiate gene transcription. This regulation ensures that the activation of NF-ÎºB, and thus the inflammatory response, is tightly controlled to prevent unnecessary or excessive inflammation that could lead to tissue damage (Hayden2004Signaling).

Furthermore, genetic variations in the promoter region of NFKBIA can affect the expression levels of IÎºBÎ±, influencing the cellular response to inflammatory stimuli and potentially altering susceptibility to various inflammatory diseases (Ali2013Functional). This highlights the critical role of NFKBIA in maintaining cellular homeostasis and the proper functioning of the immune system.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NFKBIA gene, which encodes the IÎºBÎ± protein, are associated with several immunodeficiency syndromes, prominently featuring anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID). These conditions are characterized by a spectrum of symptoms including susceptibility to infections, impaired ectodermal development, and immune dysfunction. Specific mutations like S32I, S32R, S32N, S32G, and M37K in NFKBIA lead to gain-of-function effects, enhancing the inhibitory activity of IÎºBÎ± on the NF-ÎºB pathway, thereby reducing NF-ÎºB-mediated immune responses (Boisson2017Human).

Clinical manifestations of NFKBIA mutations include severe immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, and developmental anomalies such as sparse hair, dental anomalies, and absence of sweat glands. Some patients also exhibit non-infectious systemic inflammation and severe complications like respiratory failure, which are not responsive to typical infection treatments but can be somewhat controlled with corticosteroids (Moriya2018IKBA).

Treatment for conditions arising from NFKBIA mutations varies based on the severity and specific mutation but may include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and long-term prophylaxis against specific pathogens to manage impaired B-cell immunity (Boisson2017Human). The clinical heterogeneity among patients with NFKBIA mutations necessitates tailored treatment approaches based on individual genotypes and phenotypes.

## Interactions
NFKBIA, encoding the IÎºBÎ± protein, interacts primarily with NF-ÎºB transcription factors, particularly the p65:p50 heterodimer, to inhibit their nuclear translocation and activation. IÎºBÎ± masks the nuclear localization sequence of p65, retaining NF-ÎºB in the cytoplasm and preventing its DNA-binding activity in the nucleus (Brown1993Mutual; Hayden2008Shared). Beyond this canonical role, IÎºBÎ± also associates with histone deacetylases (HDACs), specifically HDAC1 and HDAC3, which contributes to transcriptional regulation by retaining these HDACs in the cytoplasm (Espinosa2021NF-ÎºB-Dependent). Additionally, IÎºBÎ± can bind directly to chromatin at specific genomic regions, influencing the activity of the polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2) and facilitating gene activation in response to inflammatory cytokines (Espinosa2021NF-ÎºB-Dependent).

In the context of cancer, IÎºBÎ± forms complexes with BCR-ABL and p53 proteins in chronic myeloid leukemia, retaining p53 in the cytoplasm and inhibiting its tumor-suppressor function in the nucleus (Espinosa2021NF-ÎºB-Dependent). This interaction highlights a broader network involving IÎºBÎ±, which plays a significant role in modulating cellular responses through both NF-ÎºB-dependent and independent pathways.
