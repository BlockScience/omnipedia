# IL27

## Overview
IL27 is a gene that encodes the cytokine interleukin 27 (IL-27), which is involved in the regulation of immune system responses. IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine, consisting of two subunits: IL-27p28 (also known as IL-27Î±) and Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3). These subunits function together to exert biological effects, primarily through interactions with a specific receptor complex composed of gp130 and IL-27 receptor alpha (IL-27Ra). IL-27 plays a critical role in the initiation and regulation of Th1 cell responses and exhibits both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a significant factor in immune homeostasis and a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various immune-related diseases (Schneider2010ILâ27; Hall2012The).

## Structure
Interleukin 27 (IL-27) is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of two subunits: IL-27p28 and Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3). The IL-27p28 subunit, also known as IL-27Î±, is characterized by a four-helix bundle motif, typical of cytokines that interact with type I cytokine receptors (MÃ¼ller2019A; Hall2012The). This structural motif suggests its secondary structure predominantly includes alpha helices (Batten2007The). EBI3, on the other hand, structurally resembles a soluble cytokine receptor and contains two fibronectin domains, indicating a different structural motif compared to IL-27p28 (MÃ¼ller2019A).

The heterodimerization of IL-27p28 and EBI3 is crucial for the secretion and functional activity of IL-27, as IL-27p28 on its own is poorly secreted and lacks obvious biological properties (MÃ¼ller2019A; Hall2012The). The noncovalent assembly of these subunits into the functional cytokine IL-27 is essential for its biological activity, highlighting the importance of its quaternary structure (MÃ¼ller2019A).

Post-translational modifications such as O-glycosylation and the formation of disulfide bonds play significant roles in the stability and secretion of IL-27. Specifically, the presence of a cysteine residue at a specific position significantly affects the secretion behavior of IL-27Î± by allowing disulfide bond formation, which is crucial for proper folding and stability of the protein (MÃ¼ller2019A).

## Function
Interleukin 27 (IL27) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in immune regulation and signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It is composed of two subunits, Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) and IL-27p28, and signals through a receptor composed of gp130 and IL-27Ra (WSX-1 or TCCR). This interaction activates several signaling pathways, including the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which are essential for various cellular responses (Wang2016Regulation; Hall2012The).

IL27 promotes the differentiation and function of Th1 cells, enhancing their ability to produce interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), which is crucial for the immune response against pathogens. It also influences the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, enhancing their cytotoxic functions (Schneider2010ILâ27; Hall2012The). Additionally, IL27 can inhibit the activity of Th2 and Th17 cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and can modulate the function of dendritic cells and macrophages depending on the context (Wang2016Regulation; Hall2012The).

In terms of its role in B cell biology, IL27 influences B cell proliferation, differentiation, and antibody production, particularly affecting immunoglobulin class switching to IgG1 and IgG2a (Wang2016Regulation). This cytokine also plays a role in the suppression of inflammatory responses, contributing to the maintenance of immune homeostasis and potentially offering therapeutic targets for various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Hall2012The).

## Clinical Significance
IL27 gene polymorphisms have been associated with various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in both autoimmune and cancer-related conditions. Specific polymorphisms such as rs153109 and rs17855750 have been linked to an increased risk of several cancers, including gastrointestinal, colorectal, breast, esophageal, cervical, ovarian, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Moazeni-Roodi2020Association; Nie2016Association; Ghavami2017Association). In the context of autoimmune diseases, IL27 polymorphisms have been implicated in the susceptibility to ulcerative colitis, with certain variants potentially decreasing the risk of developing this condition (Yamamoto-Furusho2016Protective). Additionally, the gene has been studied for its association with autoimmune thyroid diseases, where significant associations were found with conditions such as Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (He2019Association).

Moreover, IL27's role extends to influencing the risk and clinical manifestations of other conditions like pre-eclampsia and pulmonary tuberculosis, although findings have been mixed, indicating the complex nature of its involvement in human diseases (Gao2024The; Liu2016Polymorphisms). These associations underscore the gene's broad impact on immune regulation and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in various inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.

## Interactions
Interleukin 27 (IL-27) engages in complex interactions with other proteins, primarily through its receptor components IL-27RÎ± and gp130, to initiate signaling pathways crucial for immune regulation. IL-27 is a heterodimer composed of the p28 and Epstein-Barr Virus-Induced 3 (Ebi3) subunits. It forms a quaternary complex with IL-27RÎ± and gp130, involving multiple binding sites that facilitate its signaling function. The interaction between p28 and Ebi3 subunits at Site 1 is mediated by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, crucial for the structural integrity of IL-27. Additionally, Site 2a and Site 2b involve interactions of p28 and Ebi3 with IL-27RÎ±, respectively, characterized by stem-stem contacts and a high degree of shape and charge complementarity. Site 3 includes the interaction of the D1 Ig domain of gp130 with both p28 and Ebi3, anchored by a conserved tryptophan on p28 (NA2022Micrographs).

Moreover, IL-27 interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin and heparan sulfate, which can modulate its activity by inhibiting its ability to activate STAT signaling pathways and bind to its receptor, IL-27RÎ±. These interactions involve competitive inhibition where the binding sites for GAGs and IL-27RÎ± on IL-27 might overlap, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that affects IL-27's biological functions (CavÃ©2020Glycosaminoglycans).
