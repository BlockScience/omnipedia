# NUP214

## Overview
NUP214 is a gene that encodes the protein nucleoporin 214, a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) primarily located on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. This protein plays a pivotal role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and RNA, facilitating their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Nucleoporin 214 is characterized by a complex structure that includes a Î²-propeller domain, coiled-coil motifs, and a C-terminal with FG-repeats, which are essential for its interaction with other proteins such as CRM1, a major exportin (Mendes2019NUP214; Napetschnig2007Crystal). The protein's function is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its role during different cellular processes including mRNA export and cell cycle regulation (Napetschnig2007Crystal). The interactions and modifications of NUP214 highlight its significance in maintaining cellular function and its involvement in various pathological conditions when mutated.

## Structure
NUP214, also known as nucleoporin 214, is a multifaceted protein integral to the function of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Structurally, NUP214 is characterized by a N-terminal Î²-propeller domain, which consists of seven blades each formed by four antiparallel Î²-strands. This domain is crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions within the NPC (Napetschnig2009Structural; Napetschnig2007Crystal). The Î²-propeller is followed by a flexible linker and two central coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the interaction with another nucleoporin, NUP88, and help anchor NUP214 to the NPC (Mendes2019NUP214). The C-terminal region of NUP214 contains numerous FG-repeats and is involved in interactions with various proteins, including CRM1, a major exportin, which shows the highest affinity for CRM1 among all nucleoporins (Mendes2019NUP214).

Post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating NUP214's function. Phosphorylation sites, including a potential site at Ser-201 within the 4AB loop, are critical for its function and regulation, particularly during interphase and mitosis (Napetschnig2007Crystal).

The interaction of NUP214 with the DEAD-box helicase Ddx19 is facilitated by the 6D7A loop of the Î²-propeller, which is essential for recruiting Ddx19 to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, thus promoting mRNA export (Napetschnig2009Structural). This interaction is characterized by strong opposing electrostatic surface potentials, enhancing the binding specificity between these proteins (Hoelz2011The).

## Function
NUP214 encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), primarily localized on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. It plays a significant role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, particularly in the export of proteins and RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. NUP214 forms a subcomplex with Nup88 and is involved in the CRM1-dependent nuclear protein export pathway. This pathway is essential for the efficient export of various proteins, including transcription factors and viral proteins, from the nucleus (Hutten2006Nup214).

The protein structure of NUP214 includes a 450-residue N-terminal domain, which is significant for its interaction with the DEAD-box helicase Ddx19. This interaction is crucial for the remodeling of mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) and aids their export to the cytoplasm, highlighting NUP214's role in mRNA export (Napetschnig2009Structural).

Additionally, NUP214 is implicated in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. It is recruited to mitotic spindles, indicating a role in chromosome segregation and cell division. Deficiency in NUP214 leads to severe cellular dysfunctions, including cell cycle arrest and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport (Bhattacharjya2015Inhibition; Shamseldin2019NUP214). This multifaceted involvement in both transport and cell division processes underscores the essential nature of NUP214 in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
NUP214 mutations and alterations are implicated in several severe diseases and conditions, primarily affecting neurological and hematological health. Pathogenic variants in the NUP214 gene have been linked to acute febrile encephalopathy, characterized by fever-induced acute encephalopathy, developmental regression, progressive microcephaly, and brain atrophy. These variants disrupt nuclear transport and cellular responses to stress, contributing to neurological manifestations (Fichtman2019Pathogenic).

In the realm of oncology, NUP214 is notably involved in various hematological malignancies through its role in fusion genes. The NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene, identified in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), acts as a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase and is sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib. Another fusion, DEK-NUP214, is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is linked to poor prognosis and rapid disease progression (Graux2004Fusion; Mendes2019NUP214). Additionally, the SET-CAN/NUP214 fusion gene has been associated with T-ALL and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), indicating a high proliferation status and severe symptoms such as anemia, fever, and organ enlargement (Song2023SET-CAN/NUP214).

These findings underscore the critical role of NUP214 in both developmental and oncological contexts, highlighting its importance in cellular functions and its impact on human health when mutated or altered.

## Interactions
NUP214 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. It forms a complex with CRM1, a major exportin, where NUP214 stabilizes CRM1-export complexes at the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), enhancing the nuclear export process (Hutten2006Nup214; Port2015Structural). This interaction involves multiple FG-binding sites on NUP214 that bind into hydrophobic pockets on CRM1, facilitated by specific residues such as Phe1938 and Phe1947 of NUP214 (Port2015Structural). Additionally, NUP214 interacts with the DEAD-box helicase Ddx19, affecting its ATPase activity and mRNA export. The arginine residue at position 259 (R259) in Ddx19 is particularly crucial for binding to the N-terminal domain of NUP214, with mutations at this site significantly disrupting their interaction (Napetschnig2009Structural). NUP214 also forms interactions with other proteins involved in mRNA export, such as nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) and GLE1 (Mendes2019NUP214). Furthermore, it has been shown to interact with the influenza A virus NS2 protein, suggesting a role in viral replication or host-virus interactions (ÅENBAÅ2020Interaction). These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of NUP214 in cellular and viral processes.
