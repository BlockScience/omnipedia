# HDAC4

## Overview
HDAC4, or histone deacetylase 4, is a gene that encodes the protein histone deacetylase 4, a member of the class IIa family of histone deacetylases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression through the deacetylation of histone proteins, impacting chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. The HDAC4 protein is characterized by a regulatory domain at its N-terminal and a catalytic domain containing zinc at its C-terminal, essential for its enzymatic activity. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle cell differentiation and neuronal response, through its interactions with transcription factors such as the MEF2 family and other proteins. HDAC4's function is finely regulated by post-translational modifications and its localization within the cell, which can shift between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Wang1999HDAC4; Joshi2013The).

## Structure
HDAC4, or histone deacetylase 4, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that plays a crucial role in its function as a deacetylase enzyme. The protein consists of a regulatory domain at the N-terminal and a zinc-containing catalytic domain at the C-terminal. The N-terminal domain includes a glutamine-rich region that folds into a straight Î±-helix, forming a tetramer structure crucial for interaction with specific transcription factors (Wang2014HDAC4:). The C-terminal domain is essential for substrate recognition and associates with the HDAC3-N-CoR corepressor complex (Wang2014HDAC4:).

The HDAC4 protein exhibits a layered alpha-beta-alpha fold with a central parallel beta-sheet consisting of eight beta-strands, similar to that of HDAC8. This structural arrangement includes a unique structural zinc-binding domain that stabilizes two segments of the protein, contributing four zinc ligands, strictly conserved in all class IIa enzymes (Bottomley2008Structural). This zinc-binding domain exhibits conformational flexibility, changing between 'closed' and 'open' states depending on whether an inhibitor is bound, significantly affecting the enzyme's function (Bottomley2008Structural).

HDAC4 undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, sumoylation, carbonylation, ubiquitination, and proteolytic cleavage, which are significant in regulating the protein's function, stability, and interaction with other cellular components (Wang2014HDAC4:). These modifications and the structural features of HDAC4 are critical for its role in transcriptional repression and interaction with transcription factors and other proteins.

## Function
HDAC4, or histone deacetylase 4, is a crucial enzyme in the regulation of gene expression through its role in chromatin remodeling. It functions by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone proteins, leading to a more condensed chromatin structure and reduced transcriptional activity. HDAC4 is part of the class IIa HDACs and does not possess intrinsic DNA-binding ability, relying instead on interactions with other transcription factors for recruitment to gene promoters (Wang1999HDAC4).

A key aspect of HDAC4's function is its interaction with the MEF2 family of transcription factors, particularly MEF2C and MEF2D. These interactions are essential for the repression of specific genes involved in muscle cell differentiation and other developmental processes. HDAC4 can repress transcription by being tethered to promoters through these transcription factors, and it has specific repression domains that contribute to its regulatory functions (Wang1999HDAC4).

Moreover, HDAC4's activity is modulated by its localization within the cell. It can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, influencing not only gene expression but also other cytoplasmic functions. This nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is regulated by phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, which dictate its localization and function (Joshi2013The).

Overall, HDAC4 plays a significant role in cellular processes by modulating the structure of chromatin and the activity of transcription factors, thereby influencing gene expression patterns crucial for development and cellular differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
HDAC4 mutations and alterations are implicated in a range of diseases, most notably in cancer and developmental disorders. In cancer, mutations in HDAC4 are prevalent in soft tissue sarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer. These mutations often correlate with high mutational burdens from environmental carcinogens and are linked to tumor aggressiveness and characteristics, such as altered subcellular localization of HDAC4 which influences tumor behavior (Cuttini2023HDAC4).

In the realm of developmental disorders, HDAC4 haploinsufficiency is a primary cause of 2q37 deletion syndrome, characterized by intellectual impairment, brachydactyly type E, and distinct facial features. This genetic condition shows variable expressivity in terms of intellectual disability and physical manifestations (Williams2010Haploinsufficiency). Additionally, mutations in HDAC4 are linked to Brachydactyly Mental Retardation Syndrome (BDMR), presenting with developmental delays, behavioral problems, and skeletal abnormalities (Williams2010Haploinsufficiency).

Furthermore, HDAC4 mutations have been associated with diabetes, particularly affecting insulin secretion and Î²-cell function. These mutations disrupt the normal function of pancreatic Î²-cells, contributing to severe hyperglycemia and necessitating insulin therapy in affected individuals (Gong2019HDAC4). This highlights the gene's critical role in metabolic regulation alongside its implications in neurological and developmental health.

## Interactions
HDAC4, a class IIa histone deacetylase, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play critical roles in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with the MADS-box transcription factors MEF2C and MEF2D, crucial for recruiting HDAC4 to promoters due to its lack of intrinsic DNA-binding ability. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal domain of HDAC4, specifically residues 118 to 208 (Wang1999HDAC4). HDAC4 also forms complexes with other histone deacetylases such as HDAC3, suggesting possible homodimerization or heterodimerization, which are significant for its role in transcriptional repression (Wang1999HDAC4).

Additionally, HDAC4 interacts with the Serum Response Factor (SRF), where it is recruited as part of the SRF complex on muscle promoters. This interaction is influenced by intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, which can disrupt the HDAC4/SRF association (Davis2003Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent).

HDAC4 also interacts with ATF4, where specific regions between these proteins facilitate their interaction, influencing processes such as ER stress-induced apoptosis (Zhang2014HDAC4). Furthermore, HDAC4 is part of the HDAC3/N-CoR co-repressor complex, mediated by its structural zinc-binding domain, essential for its regulatory function (Bottomley2008Structural). These interactions highlight HDAC4's integral role in modulating transcriptional activity and cellular responses through various dynamic and structural associations with other proteins.
