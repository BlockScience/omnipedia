# BAIAP2

## Overview
BAIAP2, or Brain-specific Angiogenesis Inhibitor 1-associated protein 2, encodes the protein BAR/IMD domain containing adaptor protein 2, which is integral to cellular morphology and motility. This gene is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines and synaptic structures essential for neuronal communication. The protein itself is a multi-domain scaffolding and adaptor protein that interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and various signaling molecules to regulate membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization. Its interaction with proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac plays a crucial role in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, structures vital for cell migration and signaling (Scita2008IRSp53:; Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2). BAIAP2's involvement in synaptic functions and its association with several neuropsychiatric disorders highlight its importance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2).

## Structure
BAIAP2, also known as IRSp53, is a multidomain scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics, essential for cellular processes such as filopodia and lamellipodia formation. The protein is characterized by several domains that facilitate its function. The N-terminal IMD (IRSp53/MIM homology domain), also known as the I-BAR domain, is involved in binding and deforming phosphoinositide-rich membranes and can also bind and bundle actin filaments. This domain forms antiparallel dimers, leading to the dimerization of full-length IRSp53 proteins in a head-to-head manner (Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2). The CRIB-PR domain binds the GTP-bound form of the small GTPase Cdc42, enhancing filopodium formation (Millard2005Structural). The SH3 domain interacts with various actin modulatory proteins and is regulated by an intramolecular interaction with the CRIB-PR domain, which is relieved upon Cdc42 binding (Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2). Additionally, BAIAP2 contains a WW domain, a WH2 domain, and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which interacts with diverse PDZ domain-containing scaffolding proteins (Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2). Alternative splicing results in multiple splice variants of IRSp53, which mainly differ in the C-terminal region (Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2). These structural features collectively contribute to BAIAP2's role in actin cytoskeleton organization and membrane dynamics.

## Function
BAIAP2, also known as IRSp53, is a multi-domain scaffolding and adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of membrane and actin dynamics within cells. It is involved in the formation of membrane protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia, which are essential for cellular processes like migration, adhesion, and signaling. The IMD (IRSp53-MIM homology domain) of BAIAP2 binds to and deforms phosphoinositide-rich membranes, facilitating the formation of tubular structures and influencing membrane curvature. This activity is crucial for the dynamic restructuring of the cytoskeleton and membrane morphology (Scita2008IRSp53:; Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2).

BAIAP2 also interacts with small GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac, which are key regulators of actin polymerization. Through these interactions, BAIAP2 organizes macromolecular complexes at membrane sites that influence the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton and spatial dynamics of cell signaling (Scita2008IRSp53:; Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2). Additionally, BAIAP2 is involved in synaptic functions, particularly in the development of dendritic spines and regulation of NMDA receptor function, which are critical for synaptic signaling and plasticity in neuronal cells (Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2). This involvement underscores its importance in cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and its implication in various psychiatric disorders.

## Clinical Significance
BAIAP2 has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, primarily through associations with genetic variations and their impact on brain function. Notably, mutations and alterations in the expression of BAIAP2 are linked to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), schizophrenia, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In autism, a study found a nominal association between the BAIAP2 gene and the condition, particularly under a recessive model involving the SNP rs11657991 (Toma2011Association). Further research supports BAIAP2's involvement in ASDs, schizophrenia, and ADHD, highlighting its role in normal brain functions and the pathophysiology of these disorders (Kang2016IRSp53/BAIAP2).

In the context of ADHD, BAIAP2 has been associated with the predominantly inattentive subtype in Chinese Han subjects, with significant associations found for specific SNPs (Liu2013BAIAP2). Additional studies have confirmed BAIAP2's association with ADHD in various populations, although findings have varied, suggesting potential population-specific genetic effects or clinical heterogeneity (RibasÃ©s2009Case-Control).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of BAIAP2 in contributing to the etiology of major psychiatric disorders, mediated by its role in synaptic function and neuronal development.

## Interactions
BAIAP2, also known as IRSp53, interacts with various proteins through distinct domains, influencing cellular functions such as cytoskeletal rearrangements and synaptic transmission. The N-terminal IMD domain of BAIAP2 binds to F-actin, aiding in cytoskeleton dynamics and BAIAP2 dimerization (Wilkinson2020Molecular). Additionally, its CRIB-PR region interacts with the SH3 domain of BAIAP2 itself, which can inhibit its interaction with other proteins unless reversed by the binding of the small GTPase Cdc42 (Wilkinson2020Molecular). The SH3 domain of BAIAP2 also interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as dynamin and Wasf2, a member of the WAVE complex, to regulate actin dynamics (Wilkinson2020Molecular).

In the context of Huntington's disease, BAIAP2 interacts with the huntingtin protein (HTT), where mutant HTT interferes with BAIAP2's ability to induce filopodia formation, suggesting a role for BAIAP2 in filopodia formation and cellular morphology changes (Tourette2014A). BAIAP2 also forms a complex with Robo2, crucial for epithelial cell development and differentiation, influencing the phosphorylation of MDM2 and the stability of p53, impacting processes like cellular senescence and the pathology of renal cystic diseases (Li2019Disruption). These interactions underscore BAIAP2's role in various signaling pathways and cellular processes, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states.
