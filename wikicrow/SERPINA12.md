# SERPINA12

## Overview
SERPINA12 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family A member 12, commonly known as vaspin. Vaspin is a serine protease inhibitor that belongs to the serpin superfamily, characterized by its ability to inhibit proteases involved in various physiological processes. The protein is primarily expressed in visceral adipose tissues and plays a significant role in metabolic regulation, particularly in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Vaspin's function extends to influencing cellular responses to metabolic stress, potentially impacting conditions such as diabetes and obesity. The gene and its protein product are also implicated in various clinical conditions, including dermatological and metabolic disorders, highlighting their importance in both health and disease (Heiker2013Vaspin; Kurowska2021Review:).

## Structure
SERPINA12 encodes the vaspin protein, a member of the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors. The protein structure of vaspin includes typical serpin features such as three Î²-sheets and nine Î±-helices, which constitute its secondary structure (Heiker2014Vaspin; Breitfeld2013Analysis). The reactive center loop (RCL), a critical component of the serpin mechanism, extends from glycine 364 to proline 381 and includes key residues methionine 378 and glutamate 379, which are involved in protease cleavage (Heiker2014Vaspin).

The tertiary structure of vaspin is characterized by its serpin domain, which includes a conserved arrangement of Î²-sheets and Î±-helices that facilitate the transition from a high-energy state to a more stable conformation upon protease interaction. This transition involves the insertion of the RCL as an additional Î²-strand into the central Î²-sheet, expanding it from five to six strands (Pippel2016Crystal).

Vaspin is also glycosylated, with three predicted glycosylation sites in the N-terminus, which are important for its function but do not hinder its inhibitory activity against kallikrein 7 (Kurowska2021Review:). This post-translational modification can increase the molecular weight of vaspin by about 7.5 kDa. The specific domains and interactions, such as the salt bridge and water-mediated hydrogen bond between residues in the RCL and Î²-sheet C, are crucial for maintaining the stability and functionality of the protein (Kurowska2021Review:).

## Function
SERPINA12, also known as vaspin, encodes a serine protease inhibitor that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and insulin regulation. The protein is predominantly expressed in visceral adipose tissue and has been identified as an adipokine. Vaspin improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity by inhibiting specific proteases that degrade insulin, thereby stabilizing insulin levels in the bloodstream. This action is primarily mediated through the inhibition of the serine protease kallikrein 7 (hK7), which is known to cleave insulin and other substrates. The interaction between vaspin and hK7 involves the formation of a stable complex, preventing hK7 from degrading insulin and thus promoting better glucose uptake without directly increasing insulin secretion or sensitivity (Heiker2013Vaspin).

Additionally, vaspin is involved in cellular responses to metabolic stress. It interacts with the cell-surface protein GRP78, a key player in endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. This interaction suggests a role for vaspin in modulating cellular stress mechanisms, which could influence metabolic processes and insulin signaling pathways (Nakatsuka2012Vaspin). 

Overall, SERPINA12's function in regulating insulin levels and responding to metabolic stress highlights its importance in metabolic homeostasis and potentially in the pathophysiology of diabetes and obesity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERPINA12 gene are linked to autosomal recessive palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), a condition characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms and soles. Specific loss-of-function variants, such as c.631C>T and c.1051G>T, result in premature termination codons that significantly reduce the expression of vaspin, the protein encoded by SERPINA12. This reduction disrupts normal skin differentiation and adhesion by affecting the levels of proteins like desmoglein-1 and corneodesmosin, essential for cell-cell adhesion and integrity (Mohamad2020Loss-of-Function).

Beyond dermatological implications, alterations in SERPINA12 expression and vaspin function are implicated in various metabolic disorders. Vaspin is noted for its role in obesity and insulin resistance, conditions where its levels are variably expressed depending on the metabolic state of the individual. It has been observed that in obesity, vaspin can act as a compensatory factor to improve insulin sensitivity (Heiker2014Vaspin; Nakatsuka2012Vaspin). Additionally, vaspin's involvement in systemic sclerosis suggests a broader immunological role, although its levels in such patients do not significantly differ from healthy controls (Miura2015Serum).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of SERPINA12 in both skin-related and systemic diseases, highlighting the gene's multifaceted role in human health and disease.

## Interactions
SERPINA12, also known as vaspin, interacts with various proteins and molecules, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and protease inhibition. One of its primary interactions is with the protease KLK7, where vaspin forms a stable complex that can be analyzed using SDS-PAGE, showing a main complex at a molecular weight of 70 kDa (Tindall2020Membrane). Additionally, vaspin binds to GRP78, a 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, on the cell surface, which facilitates various intracellular signaling pathways involving multiple kinases (Kurowska2021Review:).

Vaspin also interacts with phospholipids and polyphosphates, which are crucial for membrane trafficking and cellular signaling. It binds strongly to monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs) and polyphosphate 45, influencing its interaction with KLK7 and potentially its anti-inflammatory effects in obesity (Tindall2020Membrane). Mutations in the heparin binding site of vaspin affect its binding to PtdInsPs and heparin, which are important for its regulatory role in vaspin's activity (Tindall2020Membrane).

Furthermore, vaspin is implicated in the regulation of bone homeostasis through its expression and interactions in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, as observed in studies involving FcÎ³RIIB-deficient mice (Sakunrangsit2021Identification). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of SERPINA12 in cellular functions and its potential implications in various physiological and pathological processes.
