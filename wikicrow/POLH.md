# POLH

## Overview
DNA polymerase eta (Pol Î·), encoded by the POLH gene, is a crucial enzyme in the DNA repair process, specifically known for its role in translesion synthesis (TLS). This Y-family DNA polymerase is adept at bypassing DNA lesions such as UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, thereby preventing replication fork stalling and potential genomic instability (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA). The POLH gene's product, Pol Î·, is distinguished by its ability to replicate across damaged DNA, a critical function for maintaining cellular integrity and preventing mutagenesis, which can lead to cancer (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA). Mutations in POLH are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV), highlighting its essential role in DNA damage tolerance and repair (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA).

## Structure
DNA polymerase eta (POLH), encoded by the POLH gene, is a Y-family DNA polymerase characterized by several structural domains crucial for its function in translesion synthesis (TLS). The protein includes a polymerase-associated domain (PAD), also known as the little finger domain, which is less conserved compared to other motifs but essential for the enzyme's activity (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA). POLH also features a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain, which is vital for binding ubiquitin and consists of two anti-parallel Î²-strands and a carboxy-terminal Î±-helix, with a zinc ion positioned between the Î±-helix and Î²-strands (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA).

Additionally, POLH contains two PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) domains that enhance its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), particularly important for binding to monoubiquitinated PCNA, which is crucial for TLS (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, and SUMOylation, which regulate its activity and stability. Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as serine 601, is essential for its function in damage bypass (Bertoletti2017Phosphorylation). These structural features and modifications are critical for POLH's role in bypassing DNA lesions, thereby maintaining genomic stability.

## Function
DNA polymerase eta (Pol Î·), encoded by the human POLH gene, is a specialized enzyme that plays a critical role in the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway, a DNA damage tolerance process that allows DNA replication to continue past sites of damage. This enzyme is particularly adept at bypassing UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and other lesions like those induced by platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs, which are common obstacles during DNA replication (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA). Pol Î· operates by incorporating nucleotides opposite the damaged bases, thereby preventing the stalling of the replication machinery and potential genomic instability (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA).

In healthy human cells, Pol Î· contributes to maintaining genomic integrity by allowing replication to proceed past damaged DNA that would otherwise lead to mutations or cell death. This function is crucial in preventing the accumulation of mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer, particularly skin cancers in the context of UV exposure (Jung2010Pirh2). The enzyme interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a key player in DNA replication, which is modified to facilitate TLS, highlighting the coordinated cellular response to DNA damage (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA).

The importance of Pol Î· is underscored in individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV), where mutations in POLH lead to a deficiency in this enzyme, resulting in increased sensitivity to UV light and a higher predisposition to skin cancers (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA). Thus, POLH is not only vital for the normal functioning of cellular replication machinery but also plays a protective role against DNA damage-induced pathologies.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLH gene, which encodes DNA polymerase eta, are clinically significant as they are linked to the variant form of Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP-V). Individuals with XP-V exhibit a heightened sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and are at an increased risk of developing skin cancers. This condition underscores the critical role of POLH in the DNA repair process, particularly in translesion synthesis that allows DNA replication across damaged sites (Ying2021Additive).

In the context of cancer, alterations in POLH and other POL genes have been associated with variations in tumor mutational burden (TMB) and patient survival across different cancers. Studies have shown that multiple somatic variants in POL genes, including POLH, often co-occur with DNA damage response (DDR) pathway alterations, leading to increased TMB and improved patient survival. Specifically, patients with multiple POL gene mutations, including those in POLH, have demonstrated prolonged survival, particularly when these mutations coincide with deficiencies in the DDR pathway (Ying2021Additive).

Furthermore, the presence of variants of unknown significance (VUS) in POLH, even those with minimal impact on TMB or without additional DDR pathway alterations, has been associated with a higher survival probability compared to patients negative for both POL and DDR mutations. This suggests the potential of POLH gene mutations as biomarkers for overall survival and possibly for predicting the outcome of immunotherapy and other cancer treatments (Ying2021Additive).

## Interactions
DNA polymerase eta (POLH) interacts with several proteins crucial for its function in DNA repair and replication. It binds to both unmodified and monoubiquitinated forms of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The interaction with unmodified PCNA occurs through the PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) located in the C-terminal of POLH, while the ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain of POLH enhances its affinity for monoubiquitinated PCNA, facilitating the switch from replicative to translesion synthesis polymerases at DNA damage sites (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA). POLH also interacts with replication protein A (RPA) and other translesion synthesis DNA polymerases such as Pol Î¹ and Pol Îº, which are essential for its localization and function in the DNA damage response (Cruet-Hennequart2009DNA).

Additionally, POLH is regulated by interactions with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which promotes its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in response to UV irradiation. This interaction is mediated by physical association between Mdm2 and POLH, as demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Jung2012DNA). Furthermore, the interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pirh2 targets POLH for degradation by the 20S proteasome, affecting its stability and function in UV-induced DNA repair (Jung2010Pirh2). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms that control POLH activity and stability, ensuring precise DNA repair and replication under stress conditions.
