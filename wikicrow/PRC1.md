# PRC1

## Overview
PRC1, or protein regulator of cytokinesis 1, is a human gene that encodes a crucial protein involved in the regulation of cytokinesis, the final step in cell division where the cell cytoplasm is divided between two daughter cells. The PRC1 protein is instrumental in stabilizing microtubules during mitosis, specifically within the spindle midzone, and is essential for the accurate segregation of chromosomes. It functions as a microtubule-associated protein that forms crossbridges between antiparallel microtubules, facilitating the proper interaction and positioning of microtubules during cytokinesis (Mollinari2002PRC1; Li2004Identification). The activity and localization of PRC1 are tightly regulated within the cell cycle, highlighting its pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell proliferation (Li2004Identification).

## Structure
The human gene PRC1 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cytokinesis and is characterized by a complex molecular structure that facilitates its function in microtubule crosslinking. The PRC1 protein exhibits a modular architecture comprising distinct domains essential for its interaction with microtubules. The central microtubule-binding domain of PRC1 features a spectrin fold, a structural motif consisting of a three-helix bundle with a hydrophobic core formed by residues from all three helices, flanked by salt bridges from conserved residues. This spectrin fold is crucial for microtubule binding, with the microtubule-binding surface primarily formed by a basic region comprising loop1-2 and adjacent helical residues (Subramanian2010Insights).

PRC1 functions as a dimer, a form of quaternary structure, which is essential for its role in forming crossbridges between antiparallel microtubule filaments. The dimerization domain projects at a specific angle relative to the microtubule lattice, determining the intermicrotubule spacing and influencing the activity of motor proteins like kinesin-5 (Subramanian2010Insights).

Post-translational modifications also regulate PRC1 activity, notably through phosphorylation. Phosphorylation sites modulate microtubule affinity, particularly through the action of Cdk1, which reduces the net positive charge during phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation of these sites activates PRC1's microtubule binding during anaphase (Subramanian2010Insights).

## Function
PRC1 (protein regulator of cytokinesis 1) is a crucial protein in human cells, primarily involved in the process of cytokinesis, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing the microtubules that form the spindle midzone during late mitosis. This stabilization is essential for successful cell division, ensuring the proper segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells (Mollinari2002PRC1; Li2004Identification). PRC1 is also involved in organizing the central spindle and maintaining the correct cellular architecture necessary for division, highlighting its critical role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell proliferation (Mollinari2002PRC1).

During cell division, PRC1 localizes to the spindle midzone and is concentrated at the midbody during cell cleavage, particularly in the Flemming body region. This localization suggests a role in organizing and stabilizing the spindle midzone, crucial for successful cytokinesis (Mollinari2002PRC1). The protein's function is further emphasized by its interaction with other mitotic proteins such as TD-60, which colocalizes with PRC1 at the spindle midzone and midbody during late mitosis (Mollinari2002PRC1).

In addition to its structural role, PRC1 is regulated throughout the cell cycle, with its expression being highly controlled. Elevated levels are observed during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, followed by a significant reduction after cells exit mitosis and enter the G1 phase (Li2004Identification). This regulation is critical for normal cell division, as disruptions in PRC1 expression can lead to abnormal cell division and the formation of binucleated cells, indicating failed cytokinesis (Li2004Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRC1 gene and alterations in its expression levels are implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), highly recurrent mutations in the PRC1 subunits BCOR and BCORL1 disrupt the assembly of the noncanonical PRC1.1 complex, leading to epigenetic reprogramming and aberrant oncogenic signaling. These mutations are associated with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to treatment (Schaefer2022BCOR). Similarly, in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), BCOR mutations are linked to advanced disease stages and clinical resistance to targeted inhibitors like BCR-ABL (Schaefer2022BCOR).

In the context of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), dysfunctions in PRC1, such as the loss of function or mutations, lead to various hematopoietic issues and contribute to the development of diseases like essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis (Sashida2019Deregulated). Additionally, mutations in PRC1-related proteins like ASXL1 in myeloid malignancies affect the function of other complexes like Ezh2-PRC2, leading to multi-lineage cytopenia and dysplasia (Sashida2019Deregulated).

These findings underscore the critical role of PRC1 in maintaining cellular regulation and its disruption in the pathogenesis of various malignancies, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PRC1, as part of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression through transcriptional activation and repression. One of the key interactions involves the association of PRC1 with Ring1b, which plays a dual role in gene regulation. Ring1b, enhanced by other PRC1 components, is crucial for H2A mono-ubiquitination leading to gene repression. However, factors like CK2 and Aurora B kinase can inhibit this activity, thereby promoting transcriptional activation. CK2 phosphorylates Ring1b, neutralizing its enzymatic activity, while Aurora B kinase targets the E2 enzyme Ube2d3 and a deubiquitinase, Usp16, to modulate H2A mono-ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination, respectively (Geng2020Mammalian).

Additionally, the PRC1.5 complex, containing AUTS2 and CK2, recruits the histone acetyltransferase P300, further facilitating transcriptional activation. This complex interaction network allows PRC1 to dynamically regulate gene expression by switching between transcriptional repression and activation (Geng2020Mammalian). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of PRC1 in chromatin modification and gene regulation, underscoring its importance in cellular processes.
