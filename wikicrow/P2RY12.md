# P2RY12

## Overview
The P2RY12 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2Y12, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) integral to the regulation of platelet activation and aggregation, a key process in thrombus formation. This receptor is predominantly expressed in platelets and certain cells of the central nervous system, such as microglia. P2Y12 plays a crucial role in the cardiovascular system by mediating the response to ADP, a platelet activator, which binds to the receptor triggering a series of intracellular reactions that promote platelet aggregation. Additionally, P2Y12 is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including thrombosis and inflammation, making it a significant target for antithrombotic drugs like clopidogrel and prasugrel (Mundell2018Receptor). The receptor's importance in both health and disease underscores the clinical significance of its study, particularly in understanding and treating disorders related to excessive or insufficient platelet aggregation (Lecchi2016Inherited).

## Structure
The P2Y12 receptor, encoded by the P2RY12 gene, is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation. Structurally, the P2Y12 receptor consists of 342 amino acids and features a typical GPCR architecture with seven transmembrane helices. These helices are not perpendicular to the membrane plane but are tilted or kinked, with the carboxy-terminal helix VIII running parallel to the membrane lipid bilayer (Cattaneo2015P2Y12). The receptor includes two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at its extracellular amino terminus, which may influence its activity (Cattaneo2015P2Y12).

The receptor's structure is further characterized by the presence of two disulfide bonds, one between cysteine 17 and cysteine 270, and another between cysteine 97 and cysteine 175, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity (Cattaneo2015P2Y12). Additionally, the receptor binds two cholesterol molecules, potentially playing a role in signal transduction (Cattaneo2015P2Y12).

In terms of ligand interaction, the binding of agonists like 2-methylthio-ADP (2MeSADP) to the P2Y12 receptor causes a conformational change in the extracellular loops, leading to an inward movement of the transmembrane helices, which tighten the negatively charged phosphate groups (Cattaneo2015P2Y12). This structural flexibility is essential for the receptor's ability to recognize and bind various negatively charged nucleotide ligands, demonstrating significant plasticity particularly in its extracellular regions (Zhang2014Agonist-bound).

## Function
The P2RY12 gene encodes the P2Y12 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a critical role in platelet aggregation and activation, essential for normal blood clotting processes. This receptor is activated by ADP, leading to a cascade of intracellular signaling events that result in platelet shape change, granule secretion, and stabilization of platelet aggregates, which are crucial in the hemostatic response to prevent excessive bleeding (Mundell2018Receptor). Mutations in P2RY12 can lead to dysfunctional platelet responses, characterized by mild to moderate mucocutaneous bleeding and excessive bleeding in response to trauma or surgery (Mundell2018Receptor).

In the central nervous system, P2RY12 is identified as a specific marker for microglial cells, the primary immune cells in the brain. In healthy conditions, it plays a crucial role in the immune surveillance of the CNS. The receptor aids microglial cells in scanning the CNS for cellular debris and mediating immune responses, supporting neuronal homeostasis and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (Zhu2017Expression). P2RY12's function is particularly significant in microglial chemotaxis and the extension of microglial processes in response to CNS injury, indicating its role in the repair processes following tissue damage (GÃ³mez2021Microglia).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the P2RY12 gene, which encodes the P2Y12 receptor, are associated with various bleeding disorders due to alterations in platelet function. For instance, inherited mutations such as the homozygous c.561T>A substitution leading to a His187 to Gln change, and other mutations like p.Arg256Gln and p.Arg265Trp, disrupt normal receptor function by affecting ligand affinity and receptor conformational changes, resulting in abnormal platelet responses to ADP and severe bleeding disorders (Lecchi2016Inherited). Additionally, a novel dominant negative variant, R265P, identified in a family with severe bleeding disorders, impairs platelet aggregation and receptor signaling, suggesting a dominant negative effect on the receptor function (Mundell2018Receptor).

Polymorphisms in the P2RY12 gene also influence the clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with clopidogrel. Certain variants are linked to a higher risk of adverse events such as stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, although these polymorphisms do not significantly affect mortality rates (Li2018Association).

These findings underscore the critical role of P2RY12 in hemostasis and thrombosis, and highlight the potential impact of its genetic variations on patient response to antiplatelet therapy and susceptibility to bleeding disorders.

## Interactions
The P2RY12 receptor interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in platelet aggregation and thrombosis. It is activated by ADP and couples with the Gi2 protein, leading to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and a reduction in cAMP levels, which promotes platelet aggregation (Chen2022Ginsenoside). This receptor also forms complexes with cholesterol molecules, which may influence its function in signal transduction (Zhang2014Structure).

In terms of drug interactions, P2RY12 is targeted by antithrombotic drugs like clopidogrel and prasugrel. These drugs bind selectively to the receptor, particularly at a site known as pocket 2, which is an energetically favorable binding site (Zhang2014Structure). Additionally, the receptor interacts with the agonist 2-methylthio-ADP (2MeSADP), which binds and causes a conformational change that is crucial for its activation (Cattaneo2015P2Y12).

Mutations in specific amino acid residues, such as R256 and R265, significantly affect the binding affinity and activation of the receptor, highlighting their importance in the receptor's interaction with both nucleotide agonists and drug metabolites (Zhang2014Structure). These interactions are essential for understanding the pharmacology and mechanisms of action of P2RY12, which are critical for developing effective therapies targeting platelet aggregation and thrombosis.
