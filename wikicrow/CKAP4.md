# CKAP4

## Overview
CKAP4, or Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4, is a gene that encodes the type II transmembrane protein known as cytoskeleton-associated protein 4. This protein is integral to various cellular functions, primarily through its roles in structural support and signaling. CKAP4 is predominantly localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum but also functions at the plasma membrane where it acts as a receptor for several ligands, influencing cellular dynamics and responses. The protein is involved in critical processes such as the maintenance of ER structure, cell migration, adhesion, and cellular signaling pathways. Its interaction with microtubules and various signaling molecules underscores its multifunctional nature, impacting not only cellular architecture but also processes like proliferation and gene expression (Tuffy2012Cytoskeleton-Associated; Chavda2017Antiproliferative).

## Structure
CKAP4, or Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4, is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by distinct structural domains that facilitate its function in cellular signaling and structural integrity. The primary structure of CKAP4 consists of 602 amino acids, with a significant portion forming a carboxyl-terminal region in the ER lumen or the extracellular space, depending on the protein's localization (Tuffy2012Cytoskeleton-Associated).

The secondary structure includes alpha helical regions and a notable leucine zipper motif within the C-terminus, which are crucial for oligomerization. This leucine zipper, found between residues 468-503, is characteristic of the bZIP DNA-binding motif, suggesting a role in genomic interactions (Tuffy2012Cytoskeleton-Associated).

At the tertiary level, CKAP4 is predicted to form coiled-coil domains, particularly in the extracellular domain, which are essential for its structural integrity and function as a receptor (Chavda2017Antiproliferative).

The quaternary structure involves the formation of homo-oligomers, facilitated by interactions between the transmembrane domains of separate CKAP4 molecules, which is critical for its retention and function in the ERGIC (Tuffy2012Cytoskeleton-Associated).

Post-translational modifications of CKAP4 include phosphorylation at multiple serine residues and palmitoylation at cysteine 100. These modifications are crucial for its interaction with microtubules, nuclear translocation, and cellular signaling pathways (Tuffy2012Cytoskeleton-Associated; Planey2009Palmitoylation).

## Function
CKAP4, also known as Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4, is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cellular structure and function. It is primarily localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in anchoring the rough ER to microtubules, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the ER and organizing the ER structure in relation to the microtubule network. This interaction facilitates various cellular processes including protein synthesis and transport (Tuffy2012Cytoskeleton-Associated; Chavda2017Antiproliferative).

Beyond its structural roles, CKAP4 functions as a receptor on the plasma membrane for several ligands such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and surfactant protein A (SP-A), influencing cellular signaling and response mechanisms. These interactions are vital for processes like surfactant secretion in alveolar type II cells and pericellular proteolytic activity, which are essential for lung function and the breakdown of blood clots, respectively (Tuffy2012Cytoskeleton-Associated; Chavda2017Antiproliferative).

CKAP4 also plays a role in cell migration and adhesion through its interaction with integrins, specifically regulating the recycling of Î±5Î²1 integrin. This regulation affects cell adhesion to fibronectin and the size of cell adhesion sites, which in turn influences cell migration (Osugi2019CKAP4). Additionally, CKAP4 is involved in signaling pathways that impact cellular proliferation and gene expression, further underscoring its multifunctional role in cell biology (Tuffy2012Cytoskeleton-Associated).

## Clinical Significance
CKAP4 (Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4) has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of various cancers, reflecting its clinical significance. In pancreatic cancer, CKAP4's interaction with proteins such as p85Î± and DKK1 through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway influences cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages (Li2021Cytoskeleton-Associated). Similarly, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CKAP4 overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes, higher TNM stages, and Fuhrman grades (Sun2017Overexpression). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CKAP4 acts as a growth inhibitor, where its higher expression levels are linked to favorable prognosis, contrasting its role in other cancers (Li2014CKAP4). Additionally, in intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC), CKAP4 overexpression correlates with distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis, serving as a prognostic biomarker for overall survival (Li2021Cytoskeleton-Associated).

CKAP4's role in cancer is influenced by its interactions with various ligands and the tumor microenvironment, which can activate specific signaling pathways, such as the DKK1/DKK3-CKAP4 axis, promoting cancer progression in certain contexts (Li2021Cytoskeleton-Associated). This dual role highlights the complexity of CKAP4's function in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CKAP4 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and structural integrity. It forms a complex with the SH3 domain of p85Î±, a regulatory subunit of PI3K, under the inducement of DKK1, which is crucial for the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is facilitated by a proline-rich region within CKAP4, highlighting its role in cell survival and proliferation (Kimura2016CKAP4; Li2021Cytoskeleton-Associated; Kikuchi2017The). Additionally, CKAP4 binds to Î²1 integrin and Î²-COP, which are involved in cellular adhesion and vesicular trafficking, respectively (Li2021Cytoskeleton-Associated).

CKAP4 also interacts with the ribonuclease dicer as part of a complex that exhibits pre-microRNA processing activity, essential for RNA interference mechanisms (Li2021Cytoskeleton-Associated). Furthermore, it interacts with various adherens junction proteins such as CDH5, JUP, DSP, and VIM in endothelial cells, partially mediated by its interaction with SENCR RNA. This interaction contributes to the integrity of the endothelial cell adherens junction protein complex, crucial for maintaining cellular membrane integrity (Lyu2018SENCRstabilizes).

At the cellular membrane, CKAP4 serves as a receptor for several ligands including tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), surfactant protein A (SP-A), and antiproliferative factor (APF), influencing processes like plasminogen activation, surfactant secretion, and cell proliferation (Kimura2016CKAP4; Kikuchi2017The). These interactions underscore CKAP4's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and its potential as a therapeutic target in various pathologies.
