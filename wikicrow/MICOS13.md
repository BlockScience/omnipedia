# MICOS13

## Overview
MICOS13, also known as QIL1 or C19ORF70, is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system subunit 13, a protein integral to the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex. This complex is crucial for maintaining the proper structure and function of mitochondria, particularly the cristae, which are the inner membrane folds where crucial elements of energy production occur. The MICOS13 protein plays a pivotal role in the stability and assembly of the MICOS complex, interacting with other subunits to ensure the proper formation and maintenance of mitochondrial architecture. Defects in the MICOS13 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its critical role in cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular health (Naha2023MIC13; Zeharia2016Mitochondrial).

## Function
MICOS13, also known as QIL1 or C19ORF70, is a critical component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, which is essential for the proper structure and function of mitochondria, particularly the cristae junctions. The protein encoded by MICOS13 is involved in the stability of the MICOS complex and influences the stability of several other MICOS subunits such as MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. It plays a pivotal role in the organization of mitochondrial cristae by interacting with other MICOS complex subunits, including MIC60, which is crucial for crista junction formation (Naha2023MIC13; Zeharia2016Mitochondrial).

MICOS13 interacts with stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP2), acting as an auxiliary subunit of the MICOS complex, helping to modulate cristae morphology and stabilize the complex. This interaction is critical for the assembly of MIC60 into the MICOS complex, promoting the formation of crista junctions by regulating the quality and stability of the MIC10-subcomplex (Naha2023MIC13).

Furthermore, MICOS13 is involved in mitochondrial quality control and assembly pathways through its coordination with the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. This coordination helps in differentially regulating the assembly pathways of the MICOS complex, linking the specific roles of MICOS13 and SLP2 with the quality control and assembly of the MICOS complex (Naha2023MIC13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MICOS13 gene, also known as QIL1, have been linked to severe mitochondrial disorders that manifest as a combination of encephalopathy, liver disease, and metabolic dysregulation. These conditions are often severe and can lead to early childhood mortality. The gene's critical role in the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex underscores its importance in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, with mutations leading to disassembly of the MICOS complex, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and impaired respiratory function (GÃ¶diker2018QIL1-dependent; Zeharia2016Mitochondrial).

Clinical presentations of MICOS13 mutations include hyperlactatemia, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, and disturbed hepatocellular function, which are indicative of mitochondrial respiratory chain defects. These metabolic disturbances are accompanied by severe neurological deterioration and liver dysfunction, often observed as hepatopathy and encephalopathy (BenincÃ¡2020Mutation; Zeharia2016Mitochondrial). Additionally, mutations in MICOS13 have been associated with bilateral kidney stones and severe neurological retardation, highlighting the broad impact of this gene on multiple organ systems (GÃ¶diker2018QIL1-dependent).

The severity of the clinical manifestations and the essential role of MICOS13 in mitochondrial integrity make it a critical focus for understanding mitochondrial diseases and developing potential therapeutic approaches. The identification of specific mutations, such as frameshift and splicing mutations, provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these severe phenotypes and offers potential targets for genetic screening and intervention (Ruiz-Pesini2021Molecular).

## Interactions
MICOS13, also known as MIC13, is a key subunit of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial structure and function. MIC13 interacts specifically with other MICOS subunits, including MIC10, MIC60, MIC26, and MIC25, which are integral to the complex's role in membrane sculpting and contact site formation (Urbach2021Conserved). The interaction between MIC13 and these subunits is mediated by specific motifs within MIC13, notably the GxxxG and WN motifs. These motifs are essential for the stability and functionality of MICOS, as they facilitate protein-protein interactions between helical transmembrane structures (Urbach2021Conserved).

Deletion variants of MIC13, such as MIC13 Î2-26 and MIC13 Î84-103, show significantly reduced interactions with other MICOS subunits, impacting the normal cristae structure and suggesting the importance of these regions in MIC13's interaction with the complex (Urbach2021Conserved). Additionally, MIC13 interacts with outer membrane proteins like SAMM50, MTX1, and MTX2, and matrix proteins such as GK, DNAJC1, and TMEM11, indicating its role in broader mitochondrial functions (Urbach2021Conserved). These interactions underscore MIC13's pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.
