# RALB

## Overview
RALB is a gene that encodes the protein RAS like proto-oncogene B, a member of the RAS family of small GTPases. This protein functions as a molecular switch within cellular signaling pathways, playing a critical role in various cellular processes including autophagy, vesicular trafficking, and exocytosis. RALB is involved in the regulation of several key cellular functions, impacting cell migration, proliferation, and survival, particularly under stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation. The protein interacts with multiple effector molecules and is involved in complex signaling networks that are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and response to environmental cues. Due to its significant role in these processes, RALB is also implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers, where it influences tumor proliferation, migration, and metastasis (Apken2021The; Bodemann2011RalB).

## Structure
The RALB protein, encoded by the RALB gene, is a member of the RAS family of small GTPases and exhibits a complex molecular structure that is crucial for its function as a molecular switch in cellular signaling pathways. The primary structure of RALB includes a G-domain, which is a 20 kDa GTP-binding domain composed of five alpha-helices and six beta-sheets. This domain contains five conserved sequence motifs (G1-G5) essential for its function, with the G1 motif including the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) that interacts with the beta and gamma phosphates of GTP (Apken2021The).

The secondary structure, as part of the G-domain, involves the alpha-helices and beta-sheets that are crucial for the stability and functionality of the protein. The tertiary structure has been elucidated through studies showing RALB bound to the GTP analog GMPPNP, revealing a very similar tertiary fold to its isoform RALA (Apken2021The).

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in the function and localization of RALB. These include geranylgeranylation at a C-terminal CaaX motif, crucial for membrane anchoring, and phosphorylation, which influences cellular localization and interaction dynamics (Apken2021The; Richardson2022The). Additionally, RALB undergoes palmitoylation, further influencing its plasma membrane localization (Apken2021The).

While the quaternary structure details and specific splice variant isoforms of RALB are not detailed in the provided sources, the existing information underscores the complexity and regulatory mechanisms that govern RALB's role in cellular processes.

## Function
RALB, a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes crucial for maintaining cellular health and responding to environmental stresses. It is particularly involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis by degrading and recycling cellular components. RALB directly influences autophagosome biogenesis, especially under nutrient starvation conditions, by interacting with Exo84, an effector protein that is part of the exocyst complex. This interaction facilitates the assembly of active ULK1-Beclin1-VPS34 complexes on the exocyst, necessary for the formation and maturation of isolation membranes into autophagosomes (Bodemann2011RalB).

Additionally, RALB is involved in vesicular trafficking and exocytosis, processes essential for normal cellular functions and response to external stimuli. It interacts with the exocyst complex subunits SEC5 and EXO84, which are crucial for the assembly of the exocyst, a complex vital for polarized exocytosis (Richardson2022The). RALB's role extends to influencing cell migration and invasion capabilities, highlighting its significance in cellular adaptability and structural dynamics (Richardson2022The).

Overall, RALB's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its critical role in cell biology, impacting both intracellular activities and broader organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
RALB, a RAS-like proto-oncogene, is implicated in various cancers through its role in tumor proliferation, migration, and metastasis. In bladder cancer, RALB supports cellular growth and drives cell motility and metastasis, which is enhanced by PKC-dependent phosphorylation (Apken2021The). In colorectal cancer, RALB acts antagonistically to RALA; while RALA promotes anchorage-independent proliferation, RALB counteracts it, utilizing SEC5 for inhibition of proliferation (Apken2021The). Overexpression of RALBP1, a RALB effector, in colorectal cancer is a prognostic marker for poor survival and early relapse, indicating RALB's relevance in human disease (Apken2021The).

In lung adenocarcinomas, particularly those with KRAS mutations, RALB is crucial for the proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells. RALB-dependent activation of TBK1, which activates anti-apoptotic NF-ÎºB signaling, is crucial for cellular survival, indicating a specific role for RALB-mediated TBK1 activation downstream of oncogenic RAS in lung cancer (Apken2021The). Genetic ablation studies in a KRAS G12D-driven lung cancer mouse model show that concurrent ablation of both RALA and RALB significantly blocks tumor development, suggesting redundant functions of these GTPases in lung cancer (Apken2021The).

In pancreatic cancer, specifically pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), RALB is activated by oncogenic KRAS mutations, crucial for the survival and invasion of PDAC cell lines, and its depletion reduces metastasis (Apken2021The). The gene is involved in the formation of invadopodia, essential for tumor invasion and metastasis, mediated by RALBP1 and essential for metalloproteinase secretion (Apken2021The).

## Interactions
RALB, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, engages in various significant protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. One of the key interactions is with RLIP76 (also known as RalBP1), where RALB binds to the GTPase Binding Domain (GBD) of RLIP76. This interaction involves specific residues such as His-413 and Trp-430 of RLIP76 forming contacts with the switch 2 region of RALB, including residues Tyr-82, Ala-48, Ala-77, and Ile-78. His-413 forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-82 of RALB, while Trp-430 interacts hydrophobically with Leu-67 and Ile-18 of RALB (Fenwick2010The). 

Mutational studies have shown that alterations in key residues like Tyr-82 to alanine significantly reduce the binding affinity between RALB and RLIP76, underscoring the importance of these interactions for the stability and function of the complex (Fenwick2010The). Additionally, mutations such as A48E and K47I/A48E in RALB can alter its specificity, enabling it to interact with RBDs of other Ras-specific effector molecules like c-Raf-1, RalGDS, and Rlf, indicating a versatile role in effector recognition and interaction specificity (Bauer1999Effector).

These interactions are not only pivotal for the signaling roles of RALB but also suggest its involvement in broader cellular functions, potentially influencing processes like vesicle trafficking, cell migration, and tumor suppression.
