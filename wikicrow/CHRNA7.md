# CHRNA7

## Overview
The CHRNA7 gene, located on chromosome 15q13.3, encodes the alpha-7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. This receptor is a homopentameric structure composed of five identical alpha-7 subunits, each contributing to the formation of the ion channel pore and the acetylcholine binding sites. The alpha-7 nAChR is crucial for modulating neurotransmitter release and is involved in various physiological processes including cognition, memory, and immunomodulation. The receptor's high calcium permeability and rapid desensitization are significant for its physiological functions. Mutations and alterations in CHRNA7 are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical importance (Gillentine2015The; Albuquerque2009Mammalian).

## Structure
The CHRNA7 gene encodes the alpha-7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is primarily composed of five identical alpha-7 subunits that form a homopentameric structure, each contributing to the formation of the ion channel pore and the acetylcholine binding sites (Lasala2018A). The primary structure of CHRNA7 includes a large extracellular agonist-binding domain, a transmembrane region consisting of four helices, and an intracellular domain that contains sites for receptor modulation and protein-protein interactions (Liu2021Structure). 

The secondary structure features a hydrophilic extracellular domain with an N-terminal Î²-sheet, followed by three hydrophobic transmembrane regions (M1-M3) that are Î±-helical, an intracellular loop, a fourth transmembrane helix (M4), and an extracellular C-terminus (Liu2021Structure). Upon agonist binding, such as acetylcholine, to the extracellular domain, all subunits undergo significant conformational changes, leading to the opening of the transmembrane hydrophilic channel (Liu2021Structure).

The quaternary structure is characterized by the symmetrical arrangement of the five subunits around a central channel axis, which is crucial for its function as a calcium-permeable ion channel (Liu2021Structure). The receptor's high calcium permeability and rapid desensitization are significant for its physiological functions, including cognition, memory, and immunomodulation (Liu2021Structure).

## Function
The CHRNA7 gene encodes the alpha-7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a type of ligand-gated ion channel predominantly expressed in the brain and involved in the transmission of neural signals across synapses. These receptors are crucial for modulating neurotransmitter release, impacting cognitive functions such as learning and memory. The alpha-7 nAChRs are known for their role in calcium signaling pathways, which are essential for various cellular functions including neuronal communication and muscle contraction (Gillentine2017Functional).

In healthy human cells, the activation of alpha-7 nAChRs by their endogenous ligands, acetylcholine and choline, leads to the influx of calcium ions. This influx is critical for triggering downstream signaling pathways that influence cellular processes such as gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal viability (Albuquerque2009Mammalian). The receptors are located both pre- and post-synaptically in the brain, influencing the release of neurotransmitters like GABA, glutamate, and dopamine, which are vital for normal brain function and cognitive processes (Sinkus2015The).

Furthermore, the alpha-7 nAChRs also play a role in the immune system and are expressed in peripheral tissues, where they modulate inflammatory responses (Sinkus2015The). The proper function of these receptors is supported by chaperone proteins such as ric-3 and lynx1, which assist in their assembly and cellular localization, ensuring effective signal transduction and cellular response to stimuli (Sinkus2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHRNA7 gene, which encodes the Î±7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, are implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Copy number variations (CNVs), including deletions and duplications at chromosome 15q13.3 where CHRNA7 is located, are associated with conditions such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Schaaf2014Nicotinic; Gillentine2015The). Deletions generally result in more severe phenotypes, including cognitive deficits, seizures, and language impairments, while duplications are linked to ASD, ADHD, and schizophrenia (Gillentine2015The).

Specific polymorphisms and mutations in CHRNA7, such as a single promoter SNP at -86C/T and a 2bp deletion in exon 6 of CHRFAM7A, are associated with schizophrenia and sensory processing deficits like the P50 sensory gating deficit (Sinkus2015The). Additionally, the gene's expression is altered in bipolar disorder, with increased Î±7nAChR expression observed in the hippocampus of bipolar patients, linking it further to cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms (Sinkus2015The).

Moreover, the presence of CHRNA7 duplications has been noted in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential link between gene dosage and the disorder (Gillentine2015The). The gene's role in these diseases is significant due to its involvement in cognitive functions and the immune system, mediated through its encoding of the Î±7 nAChR subunit, which is known for its unique physiological and pharmacological properties (Cameli2018Genetic).

## Interactions
The CHRNA7 protein, encoded by the CHRNA7 gene, is known to form homooligomeric channels and is a significant component of brain nicotinic receptors. It interacts with other proteins within the CHRNA family and with proteins such as JAK2, AKT1, and PICK1, which are implicated in neurological diseases. These interactions are crucial for neuronal differentiation and development (Yadav2017Homology).

Additionally, CHRNA7 interacts with its duplicated gene products, specifically dupÎ±7 and dupÎÎ±7, known as CHRFAM7A and CHRFAM7AÎ2bp. These interactions lead to the formation of heteropentameric structures when coexpressed with full-length Î±7 in Neuro2a cells, altering the pharmacological properties of the receptors (Wang2014The). The FRET analysis indicates that these subunits, when tagged with fluorescent proteins and incorporated into the M3-M4 loop of the receptor, are likely forming part of the same pentameric receptor complexes, suggesting a close physical interaction (Wang2014The).

Moreover, the CHRFAM7A gene products can assemble with CHRNA7 subunits to form functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, as confirmed by positive FRET signals indicating close proximity of these subunits (Sinkus2015The). This interaction is critical for the overall function and regulation of the CHRNA7 receptors.
