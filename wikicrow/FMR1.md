# FMR1

## Overview
The FMR1 gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP), a multifunctional RNA-binding protein crucial for normal cognitive development and neural function. FMRP is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity by modulating the translation and localization of various mRNAs within neurons. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind RNA through its KH domains and RGG box, and it participates in multiple cellular processes including mRNA transport, translational repression, and synaptic function regulation. Mutations or disruptions in the FMR1 gene, such as the expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats, are associated with fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, as well as other genetic disorders affecting both neurological and reproductive health (Dockendorff2018The; Mei2023The).

## Structure
The FMR1 protein, also known as Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), exhibits a complex molecular structure crucial for its function in RNA binding and neuronal development. The primary structure of FMRP includes multiple isoforms generated through alternative splicing, with variations primarily in the C-terminal region affecting mRNA-binding affinities (Zhang2019Expression). The protein's secondary structure features conserved domains such as two K-homology (KH) domains, which are central to RNA-binding, and an RGG box located near the C-terminus, involved in nonspecific RNA interactions (Zhang2019Expression; ADINOLFI1999Dissecting).

FMRP's tertiary structure includes the N-terminal domain (FNT), which is predicted to form secondary structures predominantly helical in nature. This domain is highly conserved and includes several positively charged groups that may contribute to its structural stability and function in RNA binding (ADINOLFI1999Dissecting). The protein also contains a novel independently folded domain within the first 134 residues, known as the NDF, which is capable of forming stable dimers (Adinolfi2003The).

At the quaternary level, FMRP can form homo- and heterodimers, which are essential for its biological function, suggesting a complex interaction network with other proteins such as FXR1P and FXR2P (Zhang2019Expression). Post-translational modifications of FMRP include phosphorylation, methylation, and possibly ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and interactions with RNA and other proteins (Prieto2019Post-translational). These modifications and the protein's ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm underscore its multifunctional role in cellular processes.

## Function
The FMR1 gene encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity essential for cognitive development and functioning. FMRP is a selective RNA-binding protein that inhibits the translation of its RNA targets, thereby regulating the synthesis of proteins crucial for synaptic development and function. This regulation is vital for processes such as long-term potentiation and depression, which are fundamental for learning and memory (Mila2017Fragile).

In healthy human cells, FMRP is involved in transporting and stabilizing mRNA within neurons, influencing the synthesis of other proteins important for neuronal function. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and testes, highlighting its significant role in neural and reproductive systems (Tamanini1997Differential). FMRP's activity includes the modulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) transport and translation at synaptic sites, where it acts as an RNA-binding protein and plays a crucial role at the dendritic synaptic level (Noto2016The).

Moreover, FMRP is involved in various cellular processes that are critical for normal brain function, including translational repression, synaptic maturation, and dendritic mRNA localization. It also mediates the DNA-damage response pathway by binding to methylated H3K79 chromatin, contributing to cognitive abilities and preventing intellectual disabilities (Pastori2013Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FMR1 gene, particularly expansions of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in its 5'-UTR, are linked to several distinct disorders. The full mutation, defined as over 200 CGG repeats, leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. This mutation results in hypermethylation of the FMR1 gene, silencing it and preventing the production of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), which is essential for synaptic development. The absence of FMRP manifests in a range of symptoms including intellectual disability, behavioral issues, and physical characteristics typical of FXS (Mei2023The; Pretto2014Clinical).

Premutations, consisting of 55 to 200 CGG repeats, are associated with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). FXTAS is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects mainly older men, characterized by intention tremor, gait ataxia, and cognitive decline. FXPOI affects women, leading to ovarian dysfunction and early menopause (Wheeler2017Implications; Valor2021Molecular). Additionally, premutation carriers may experience psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, and developmental issues like ADHD and autism spectrum disorders, even without full mutation (Hagerman2013Fragile; Valor2021Molecular). These conditions underscore the critical role of FMR1 gene expression and interaction in human health.

## Interactions
FMRP, encoded by the FMR1 gene, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA homeostasis and translation repression. It associates with ribosomes and polyribosomes, with its binding to polyribosomes dependent on the KH-2 domain, critical for ribosome binding. Mutations in this domain, such as Ile304Asn, disrupt this association (Suardi2020FMRP). FMRP also interacts with CYFIP1 and CYFIP2, involved in dendritic spine remodeling and translation initiation, via the KH-0 domain (Suardi2020FMRP). Additionally, it interacts with components of the microRNA pathway, including dicer and Argonaute proteins, facilitating the assembly of miRNAs on target mRNA sequences (Suardi2020FMRP).

In the context of the DNA damage response, FMRP binds chromatin at DNA break sites, facilitating the recruitment of ATR, a key protein in the DDR pathway, mediated by the histone modification methylated H3K79 (Dockendorff2018The). FMRP is also involved in the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, interacting with PIWI proteins such as Aubergine (Aub) and Piwi, which is crucial for piRNA processing and transcriptional silencing of transposable elements (Dockendorff2018The).

These interactions highlight FMRP's multifaceted role in cellular processes, impacting everything from synaptic function to genomic stability.
