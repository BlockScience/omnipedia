# TMEM239

## Overview
TMEM239 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane protein 239, which is primarily associated with the plasma membrane and involved in various transmembrane activities. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its location and function within the cell. TMEM239 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular integrity and is involved in important physiological pathways such as blood coagulation and haemostasis. The protein's significance extends to clinical contexts, where it has been identified as a prognostic factor in diseases like osteosarcoma and is implicated in conditions such as nonobstructive azoospermia and eczema through its interactions with other molecules and epigenetic modifications (Du2022A; Bo2020Long; Than2020Deep; Karmaus2018Epigenetics). Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular functions and activities of TMEM239 in both healthy and disease states.

## Function
TMEM239, a transmembrane protein, is implicated in various cellular functions primarily associated with the plasma membrane and transmembrane activities. It is involved in topological domains that are both cytoplasmic and extracellular, suggesting a role in the structural and functional aspects of cellular membranes. This involvement potentially influences critical physiological pathways such as blood coagulation and haemostasis, indicating TMEM239's role in maintaining cellular integrity (Than2020Deep). Additionally, TMEM239 has been identified as a prognostic factor in osteosarcoma, where higher expression levels may correlate with poorer survival outcomes. This association underscores its significance in disease contexts, particularly highlighting its potential impact on cell biology and tumor progression (Du2022A). However, the specific molecular functions and activities of TMEM239 within healthy human cells remain less detailed, necessitating further research to elucidate its complete role in cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM239 has been implicated in various health conditions through its differential expression and potential involvement in disease mechanisms. In the context of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by a lack of sperm in semen, TMEM239 is part of a complex network involving long noncoding RNAs and other molecules such as Hsa-miR-34-5p and PWRN2. This network suggests that TMEM239 may play a regulatory role in the pathophysiology of NOA, particularly influencing spermatogenesis in affected individuals (Bo2020Long).

Additionally, TMEM239 has been associated with eczema, a common allergic condition. Studies have identified differentially methylated CpGs between PCED1A and TMEM239, which are linked to the season of birth and the risk of developing eczema by age 18. This epigenetic modification suggests that TMEM239 could be involved in the gene-environment interactions that contribute to the onset and variability of eczema symptoms (Karmaus2018Epigenetics).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMEM239 in contributing to the molecular basis of distinct diseases, emphasizing its role in both reproductive health and immune-related conditions.
