# CD36

## Overview
CD36 is a gene that encodes the CD36 molecule, a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein widely expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, muscle, and macrophages. The CD36 protein functions primarily as a receptor involved in the uptake of fatty acids and the clearance of oxidized low-density lipoproteins, playing a critical role in lipid metabolism and immune system regulation. Structurally, CD36 features two transmembrane domains, two cytoplasmic tails, and a heavily glycosylated extracellular domain, which is essential for its interaction with multiple ligands and participation in diverse biological processes such as angiogenesis, inflammation, and atherogenesis (Chu2012CD36; Pepino2014Structure-Function). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are implicated in various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its importance in health and disease (Love-Gregory2008Variants; Masuda2015Diverse).

## Structure
The CD36 protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the CD36 gene, characterized by a complex molecular structure that supports its multifunctional roles. The protein comprises two transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic tails, with a large extracellular domain that is highly glycosylated (rac2007molecular). This extracellular domain contains three disulfide bridges crucial for its structural integrity and function (Pepino2014Structure-Function).

CD36's molecular architecture includes a central hydrophobic cavity that spans most of its length, accommodating fatty acids such as palmitic and stearic acids. This cavity is lined predominantly by hydrophobic side chains, facilitating lipid transport (Hsieh2016The). The protein also features a hairpin-like membrane topology, which is significant for its interactions with various ligands, including fatty acids and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (Pepino2014Structure-Function).

Post-translational modifications of CD36 are diverse, including phosphorylation, glycosylation, palmitoylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, which are essential for modulating its trafficking, ligand uptake, and signal transduction functions (Pepino2014Structure-Function). Additionally, alternative splicing of CD36 pre-mRNA can lead to isoforms with variations in structure and function, such as those lacking specific amino acids and glycosylation sites due to exon skipping (rac2007molecular).

Overall, the structural features and modifications of CD36 are integral to its role as a receptor involved in lipid metabolism and immune responses.

## Function
CD36, a multifunctional glycoprotein, is primarily recognized as a scavenger receptor involved in lipid metabolism and immune regulation. It facilitates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids into tissues such as muscle and adipose, which is crucial for energy storage and metabolism (Andersen2006Alternative). CD36 also plays a significant role in the clearance of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) by macrophages, a process integral to the development of atherosclerotic plaques (Maruyama2008Nrf2; VallvÃ©2002Unsaturated).

In cell biology, CD36 functions as a receptor for thrombospondin and collagen, mediating cellular adhesion and signaling pathways that influence cell structure and function (Tang1994Identification; rac2007molecular). This protein is also involved in the cytoadherence of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum, contributing to the pathology of malaria (Tang1994Identification).

Furthermore, CD36 is implicated in the immune system, particularly in the recognition and ingestion of apoptotic cells by macrophages and dendritic cells, which is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Urban2001A). The protein's role extends to modulating inflammation and angiogenesis, linking it to broader physiological and pathological processes (Andersen2006Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD36 gene and alterations in its expression levels are linked to a variety of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. CD36 deficiency, resulting from genetic mutations such as C268T and 949insA, can lead to abnormalities in myocardial uptake of long-chain fatty acids, contributing to conditions like hereditary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Masuda2015Diverse). This deficiency is also associated with altered lipid profiles, potentially leading to high plasma triglycerides and low HDL levels, and impairing glucose metabolism which may result in insulin resistance (Masuda2015Diverse).

Increased expression of CD36 has been observed in diabetic cardiomyopathy and atherosclerosis, while decreased expression is noted in pathological cardiac hypertrophy due to ischemia-reperfusion and pressure overload (Shu2020The). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD36 gene, such as rs1761667 and rs1049673, are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and extreme lipid profiles (Shu2020The).

Furthermore, CD36 interacts with nuclear receptors like PPAR and RORa, which are involved in lipid metabolism and regulation of HDL-C, highlighting its role in metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular health (Love-Gregory2008Variants). Variants in CD36 also influence susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, underscoring the gene's significant impact on metabolic and cardiovascular disorders (Love-Gregory2008Variants).

## Interactions
CD36 interacts with a variety of proteins and ligands, mediating crucial cellular functions. It serves as a receptor for thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), with specific interactions occurring through its CLESH domain. Phosphorylation of this domain can inhibit its binding capacity, highlighting a regulatory mechanism influenced by protein kinase C (Chu2012CD36). Additionally, CD36 binds to the insulin receptor (IR) in human myotubes, enhancing insulin signaling by facilitating the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, which is mediated by the recruitment of the Src family kinase Fyn (Yang2020Loss).

In the context of immune responses, CD36 interacts with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR2 and TLR6, playing a role in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens (Zingg2017Î±âTocopheryl). It also binds various forms of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) and facilitates their uptake, a process significant in the development of atherosclerosis (Banesh2022Hemin).

Furthermore, CD36 is involved in malaria pathology by binding to the CIDRa domains of PfEMP1 proteins from Plasmodium falciparum, which helps the parasite evade immune clearance by adhering to endothelial receptors (Hsieh2016The). This interaction involves a conserved hydrophobic pocket on CD36 that accommodates a phenylalanine residue from the CIDRa domains, crucial for the binding specificity and strength (Hsieh2016The).
