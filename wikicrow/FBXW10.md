# FBXW10

## Overview
FBXW10 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing 10) is a gene that encodes the protein F-box and WD repeat domain containing 10, which is a member of the F-box protein family. These proteins play a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) by functioning as part of the SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box) complex, which acts as E3 ubiquitin ligases. The protein encoded by FBXW10 is involved in the recognition and binding of specific substrates for ubiquitination, a key process in protein degradation that is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. FBXW10 is particularly important in regulating protein levels and activity within the cell, influencing various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis. The protein is also involved in the degradation of nuclear proteins, contributing to the maintenance of nuclear architecture and protein homeostasis (Luo2019FBXW10).

## Function
FBXW10 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing 10) encodes a protein that is a member of the F-box protein family, which are critical components of the SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box) complex, functioning as E3 ubiquitin ligases. This complex is essential in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a cellular pathway that regulates protein degradation. FBXW10, as an F-box protein, is involved in recognizing and binding specific substrates for ubiquitination, which is a pivotal step in the UPS. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein levels and activity within the cell, thus influencing various cellular processes including cell proliferation, DNA damage response, and apoptosis (Luo2019FBXW10).

The protein encoded by FBXW10 is involved in various molecular and cellular processes. For instance, it plays a role in the degradation of specific proteins, which is vital for controlling their levels and activity in the cell. This regulatory mechanism is essential for responding to cellular stress and maintaining overall cellular function (Luo2019FBXW10).

In the context of cellular location, FBXW10 is active in the nucleus where it targets nuclear proteins for degradation. This activity is crucial for maintaining nuclear architecture and protein homeostasis, as evidenced by its role in targeting heterochromatin proteins for degradation (Chaturvedi2010Lamin).

## Clinical Significance
FBXW10 is implicated in several cancers, notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In HCC, particularly among male patients, high expression levels of FBXW10 are associated with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and increased susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis. This gene's overexpression in transgenic mouse models leads to severe liver inflammation, fibrosis, and higher levels of vascular invasion, suggesting its role in promoting liver cancer progression (Luo2019FBXW10). FBXW10 also shows abnormal hypermethylation in RCC, particularly in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where its methylation status correlates with higher Fuhrman grades, indicating a potential role in tumor aggressiveness and progression (WANG2015Abnormal). Additionally, FBXW10 is identified as a factor associated with worse prognosis in various other cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, highlighting its broader impact across different cancer types (Huang2022Pan-cancer). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FBXW10 in cancer, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target, especially in gender and cancer-type specific contexts.

## Interactions
FBXW10 is part of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) complex, a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase that determines substrate specificity for ubiquitination. This complex is crucial for the ubiquitination process, which involves the attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on target proteins, a key step in protein degradation and functional regulation (Luo2019FBXW10; Feng2013FBXW10). Specifically, FBXW10 targets heterochromatin protein 1 isoforms HP1a and HP1b for proteasomal degradation, selectively interacting with these isoforms without affecting HP1c. This selective degradation process is activated by lamin A rod domain mutants, which upregulate FBXW10 expression (Chaturvedi2010Lamin). Additionally, FBXW10 is involved in the cytoplasmic dispersal of emerin, suggesting an impact on nuclear envelope structure, although it does not alter the levels of endogenous lamin A (Chaturvedi2010Lamin). The regulation of FBXW10 itself is influenced by O-GlcNAcylation, a form of protein modification that negatively regulates its expression and potentially its interaction with other proteins (Feng2013FBXW10).
