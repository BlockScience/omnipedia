# RRM2B

## Overview
RRM2B is a gene that encodes the ribonucleotide reductase regulatory TP53 inducible subunit M2B protein, which is crucial for DNA synthesis and repair. This protein is a key component of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme complex, essential for converting ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, the precursors needed for DNA replication and repair. RRM2B is particularly significant in maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity and is transcriptionally regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53 in response to DNA damage. The protein's role extends beyond DNA synthesis, contributing to cellular responses to oxidative stress and maintaining genomic stability, which is vital for proper cellular function and survival (Kuo2012RRM2B; Liu2005The; Link2008p53-Inducible).

## Structure
The RRM2B protein, encoded by the RRM2B gene, is a crucial component of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme, which is essential for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. This process is vital for DNA replication and repair, particularly in mitochondrial DNA maintenance in nonproliferative cells. The protein itself is part of a heterotetramer complex, consisting of two subunits: a large catalytic subunit (R1) and a smaller subunit (R2), with RRM2B specifically encoding the p53R2 form (Ait2020Prediction).

The molecular structure of RRM2B has been studied using homology modeling based on the 4DJN template, which is noted for its high resolution and favorable parameters such as Qmean, coverage, and sequence identity. This modeling helps in understanding the tertiary structure of the protein, showing how nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) can alter the protein's structure by affecting crucial amino acid interactions within the protein. These interactions include changes in hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds, which are essential for maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function (Ait2020Prediction).

While the primary sequence shows a high proportion of conserved amino acids, indicating a significant evolutionary preservation that underscores their importance in protein function, the specific secondary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available literature. Similarly, information on specific domains, protein folds, post-translational modifications, and splice variant isoforms of RRM2B is not provided in the context provided.

## Function
RRM2B, or ribonucleotide reductase regulatory TP53 inducible subunit M2B, is a protein that plays a critical role in DNA synthesis by converting ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDP) into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDP), which are essential precursors for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) during DNA replication and repair (Kuo2016PYCR1). This function is vital for maintaining the balance of nucleotides within the cell, ensuring genomic stability and proper cellular function. RRM2B is particularly important during the cell cycle, especially during the G1/S-phase transition, where it facilitates the availability of dNTPs necessary for DNA synthesis (Liu2005The).

The protein is also involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, where it is transcriptionally induced by the tumor suppressor protein p53. This induction is crucial for providing sufficient dNTPs for DNA repair processes, thereby aiding in the resolution of DNA damage and maintaining cellular integrity (Link2008p53-Inducible). Additionally, RRM2B plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial DNA content and function, which is essential for cellular energy production and overall cellular health (Kuo2012RRM2B).

Moreover, RRM2B has intrinsic catalase activity, which helps in reducing oxidative stress within the cell by converting hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, thus protecting the cell from oxidative damage and maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential (Kuo2016PYCR1). This antioxidative function is crucial, especially under stress conditions, highlighting RRM2B's role in managing cellular stress responses and promoting cell survival.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RRM2B gene are associated with a spectrum of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDDS), which are severe disorders characterized by a reduction in mitochondrial DNA in tissues that require high energy, such as muscles and the nervous system. These syndromes manifest in various forms, including myopathic, encephalomyopathic, and hepatocerebral types, each presenting with distinct clinical features (StojanoviÄ2013Infantile).

One of the primary conditions linked to mutations in RRM2B is autosomal-dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO), which involves multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, particularly affecting the muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, and can include general muscle weakness and exercise intolerance (Tyynismaa2009A).

In more severe cases, biallelic mutations in RRM2B lead to early-onset mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, presenting symptoms such as hypotonia, muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive. These conditions often result in early lethality due to multi-organ system involvement (Keshavan2020The; Penque2019A).

Additionally, RRM2B mutations have been implicated in cases with clinical features suggestive of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE), despite normal plasma thymidine levels, expanding the clinical spectrum associated with this gene (Shaibani2009Mitochondrial).

Overall, the clinical significance of RRM2B is profound, with mutations leading to a range of debilitating and often fatal mitochondrial disorders, underscoring the critical role of this gene in mitochondrial maintenance and function.

## Interactions
RRM2B interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular responses to oxidative stress and DNA repair. It forms complexes with RRM1 and RRM2, which are essential for the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) necessary for DNA repair and mitochondrial DNA synthesis (Kuo2016PYCR1). The interaction between RRM2B and RRM1 is influenced by the tagging position on RRM2B; a Flag-tag at the C-terminus reduces co-immunoprecipitation with RRM1, while N-terminal tagging preserves this association (Kuo2016PYCR1).

Additionally, RRM2B interacts with Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 and 2 (PYCR1, PYCR2), which are involved in proline synthesis and play a role in anti-oxidation. These interactions are validated through immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, confirming the formation of a complex in vivo, although the interaction appears weak or transient (Kuo2016PYCR1). Under stress conditions, such as exposure to DNA-damaging agents, RRM2B's presence in mitochondria increases, suggesting a dynamic interaction influenced by cellular stress (Kuo2016PYCR1).

These interactions highlight RRM2B's role in managing oxidative stress and maintaining cellular function during DNA damage, suggesting its importance in both the antioxidative response and the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity.
