# HKDC1

## Overview
HKDC1, or hexokinase domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes the protein hexokinase domain containing 1, a member of the hexokinase family which plays a pivotal role in glucose metabolism. This protein is involved in the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, a critical step in the glycolytic pathway that is essential for energy production in cells. Unlike its counterparts in the hexokinase family, HKDC1 exhibits unique regulatory functions due to its distinct enzymatic activity and expression patterns across various tissues (Pusec2018Hepatic; Guo2015Coordinated). The protein is not only crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis but also interacts with other proteins, influencing cellular processes ranging from energy metabolism to tumor progression and immune responses (Zhang2024HKDC1; Chen2020HKDC1). The clinical significance of HKDC1 extends to its involvement in diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and retinal degeneration, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2020HKDC1; Zhang2018Whole-exome).

## Function
HKDC1 (hexokinase domain containing 1) is a novel hexokinase identified as the fifth member of the hexokinase family, playing a crucial role in glucose metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in glycolysis, which is essential for cellular energy production. HKDC1 exhibits hexokinase activity, although at a lower rate compared to other hexokinases like HK1, suggesting a unique regulatory role in glucose metabolism (Pusec2018Hepatic; Guo2015Coordinated).

In healthy cells, HKDC1 is involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis. It is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and small intestine, indicating its importance in energy metabolism across different organ systems (Khan2018Studies). The protein localizes to the mitochondria in hepatocytes, linking it to mitochondrial function and dynamics. This mitochondrial association suggests that HKDC1 may influence mitochondrial energy metabolism, impacting processes such as glycolytic capacity, glucose oxidation, and mitochondrial membrane potential (Pusec2018Hepatic).

Moreover, HKDC1's role extends to physiological conditions such as pregnancy, where it is implicated in gestational glucose regulation. Variants in HKDC1 have been associated with gestational hyperglycemia, highlighting its potential involvement in maternal metabolism (Zhang2018Whole-exome). This multifaceted involvement in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function underscores HKDC1's critical role in cellular and organismal energy homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
HKDC1 has been implicated in several health conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. Notably, mutations in HKDC1 have been associated with autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative retinal disease that can lead to blindness. A specific homozygous missense variant in HKDC1, identified through whole-exome sequencing, has been linked to late-onset retinal degeneration in two unrelated families (Zhang2018Whole-exome). This variant results in a Threonine to Methionine substitution at a highly conserved amino acid residue, leading to a partial loss of hexokinase activity, which is crucial for the gene's function in the retina (Zhang2018Whole-exome).

In addition to its role in retinal diseases, HKDC1 has been studied for its involvement in cancer. Overexpression of HKDC1 has been linked to various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, where it promotes tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis by regulating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (Wang2020HKDC1). This suggests that HKDC1 may act as an oncogene in certain contexts, contributing to aggressive tumor features and poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (Wang2020HKDC1).

Furthermore, HKDC1 has been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Variants in the HKDC1 gene have been linked to higher maternal glucose levels during pregnancy, indicating a role in glucose metabolism that could affect gestational health (Kanthimathi2016Hexokinase). This highlights the gene's importance not only in metabolic pathways but also in pregnancy-specific glucose regulation.

## Interactions
HKDC1 interacts with several proteins to facilitate its functions in various cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HKDC1 is known to interact with STAT1 and IFNÎ³ receptor 1 (IFNGR1), particularly under IFNÎ³ stimulation. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT1 at residue Y701, a process mediated by the cytoskeleton protein ACTA2. The interaction between HKDC1 and ACTA2 is necessary for the proper localization and function of STAT1, influencing PD-L1 expression levels and impacting tumor immune evasion (Zhang2024HKDC1). Additionally, HKDC1 directly binds to STAT1, facilitating its phosphorylation and enhancing PD-L1 expression, a mechanism contributing to tumor immune evasion (Zhang2024HKDC1).

In the context of breast cancer, HKDC1 interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) on the mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is modulated by the expression levels of HKDC1 and PGC1Î², affecting mitochondrial functions and potentially influencing cellular energy dynamics and tumor growth (Chen2020HKDC1; Chen2019PGC1Î²).

These interactions highlight the role of HKDC1 in modulating immune responses and mitochondrial functions in cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
