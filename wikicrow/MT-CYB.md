# MT-CYB

## Overview
The MT-CYB gene, located within mitochondrial DNA, encodes the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b protein, a vital component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular energy production through its involvement in oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome b is specifically important for the oxidation-reduction reactions in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and contributing to the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. The protein itself is characterized by its transmembrane nature, consisting of multiple hydrophobic helices that allow it to integrate into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in the MT-CYB gene can lead to various mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its essential function in bioenergetics and cellular metabolism (Iommarini2017Mild; Song2016Human).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the MT-CYB protein, encoded by the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b gene, is crucial for its function within the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The primary structure of MT-CYB consists of approximately 380 amino acids, which fold into a series of eight transmembrane helices forming its secondary structure (Song2016Human; Zarrouk2021Dilated). These helices are predominantly hydrophobic and are essential for the protein's function in electron transfer and proton gradient generation across the mitochondrial membrane (Song2016Human).

The tertiary structure of MT-CYB includes specific domains such as the ef loop, which is involved in crucial interactions within the mitochondrial complex III. Mutations in this region can significantly affect the protein's conformation and function, as seen with the D254N mutation that alters the flexibility and conformation of the ef loop (Purhonen2020A).

MT-CYB functions as part of a larger protein complex, contributing to its quaternary structure. It is the only subunit within complex III that is encoded by mitochondrial DNA and interacts with other polypeptides to form a functional dimer, each monomer consisting of 10 or 11 subunits (Song2016Human).

Details on common post-translational modifications, prominent folds beyond the transmembrane helices, or splice variant isoforms of MT-CYB are not specified in the provided excerpts.

## Function
The MT-CYB gene encodes cytochrome b, a core component of Complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, essential for cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome b is integral to the catalytic core of Complex III, where it participates in the oxidation of ubiquinol at the Qo site. This process is crucial for the mitochondrial Q-cycle, involving the oxidation of ubiquinol (QH2) and the reduction of cytochrome c, which contributes to the generation of the mitochondrial proton motive force by pumping protons into the intermembrane space (Iommarini2017Mild; Song2016Human). 

The protein's function is vital in maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly under conditions that stress the mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as metabolic stress in a galactose medium. Under such conditions, cells with mutations in MT-CYB show reduced viability and ATP production, highlighting the gene's role in energy production and organismal survival (Iommarini2017Mild). 

Moreover, the presence of properly assembled supercomplexes, which include Complex III, appears to mitigate the detrimental effects of mutations in MT-CYB, suggesting that the structural integrity of these supercomplexes is crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial function (Iommarini2017Mild).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-CYB gene, which encodes the cytochrome b protein, are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, prominently featuring exercise intolerance and complex III deficiency in muscle tissues. These mutations can manifest as severe exercise intolerance, mitochondrial myopathy with ragged-red fibers, and isolated complex III deficiency, as evidenced by reduced activity of the respiratory-chain complex III (Andreu1999Exercise). Specific mutations, such as the 15699 GfiC transversion, lead to severe symptoms including muscle weakness, episodes of pigmenturia, and lactic acidosis, with biochemical studies revealing significant decreases in the activities of respiratory chain complexes I and III (Blakely2005A).

Additionally, MT-CYB mutations are linked to multisystem disorders like mitochondrial encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. The clinical presentations of these mutations are diverse, ranging from neurological deficits to heart and vision problems, often exacerbated by physical exertion (Blakely2005A; Mori2015Complex). The detection of these mutations typically requires testing of muscle mitochondrial DNA, as they may not be detectable in other tissues like blood or skin fibroblasts, indicating a muscle-specific expression pattern (De1999A).

## Interactions
MT-CYB, encoded by mitochondrial DNA, is a core component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (cIII), where it plays a pivotal role in electron transfer and proton translocation. It is integral to the dimeric structure of cIII, which consists of ten different subunits and is involved in the formation of respiratory supercomplexes (SCs) that facilitate the biogenesis and functional integration of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Protasoni2020Respiratory). MT-CYB physically interacts with complexes I and IV within these supercomplex structures, known as respirasomes, which are critical for the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Protasoni2020Respiratory).

In the assembly of mitochondrial complex III (cIII2), MT-CYB interacts with several structural subunits and an assembly factor. Peptides corresponding to six structural cIII2 subunits (UQCRC1, MT-CYB, UQCRH, UQCRB, UQCRQ, UQCR11) and the assembly factor UQCC2 were found only in wild-type mitochondria, indicating their absence and disrupted interactions in MT-CYB deficient cells. UQCC2 binds to nascent MT-CYB during the early stages of cIII2 assembly, suggesting a direct interaction crucial for the proper assembly of this complex (Protasoni2020Respiratory).
