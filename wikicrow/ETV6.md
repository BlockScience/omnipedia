# ETV6

## Overview
ETV6, or ETS variant transcription factor 6, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the ETS family, primarily involved in hematopoiesis and cellular development. The ETV6 protein functions as a transcriptional repressor, distinct from many other Ets proteins, and plays a critical role in various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and senescence. It is characterized by a highly conserved ETS domain that binds DNA at specific sequences and a pointed (PNT) domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions and oligomerization. ETV6 is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms including autoinhibition, which modulates its DNA-binding activity and transcriptional repression capabilities. Mutations and alterations in the ETV6 gene are associated with several hematological disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in medical genetics and oncology (Montpetit2001Comparative; Coyne2012Autoinhibition; Rasighaemi2017ETV6).

## Structure
The ETV6 protein, encoded by the ETV6 gene, exhibits a complex molecular structure integral to its function as a transcriptional repressor. The protein is characterized by several domains that contribute to its DNA-binding and regulatory activities. The ETS domain, spanning residues 337-415, is crucial for DNA binding and adopts a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) motif, which is typical for the ETS family of transcription factors (Coyne2012Autoinhibition). This domain specifically recognizes DNA sequences containing a core 5â² GGA(A/T) 3â² motif (De2014ETV6).

ETV6 is regulated by auto-inhibition mechanisms involving a C-terminal inhibitory domain (CID), which includes helices H4 and H5. These helices sterically block the DNA-binding interface of the ETS domain, reducing its affinity for DNA by approximately 50-fold (Green2010DNA; De2014Steric). The CID's helices are described as marginally stable, allowing for necessary conformational changes for DNA binding (De2014Steric).

Additionally, the protein features a PNT domain that facilitates self-association and cooperative DNA binding, compensating for the low affinity caused by auto-inhibition (Coyne2012Autoinhibition). This domain also interacts with tandem consensus DNA sites, enhancing the repressive activity of ETV6 (Coyne2012Autoinhibition).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and sumoylation at specific residues are known to influence the DNA-binding affinity and regulatory functions of ETV6, further modulating its interaction with DNA and other proteins (Coyne2012Autoinhibition). Variations in the protein structure, including splice variant isoforms, contribute to the functional diversity of ETV6, affecting its expression and solubility (De2014Steric).

## Function
ETV6, also known as TEL, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including hematopoiesis, the development of blood cell lineages, and cellular senescence. It functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, different from most Ets proteins, by recruiting proteins involved in the histone-deacetylase pathway. This activity helps regulate gene expression by modifying chromatin structure, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and differentiation (Montpetit2001Comparative).

In the nucleus, ETV6 binds to specific DNA sequences through its highly conserved ETS domain, recognizing a purine-rich GGAA/T core motif within the promoters of target genes. This binding is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in cell growth and development (Montpetit2001Comparative). Additionally, ETV6 can dimerize through its conserved pointed oligomerization domain (PNT domain), allowing interaction with itself or other partners such as UBC9 and Fli-1, which further modulates its transcriptional repression activity (Montpetit2001Comparative).

ETV6 is also implicated in cellular senescence, influencing the expression of splicing factors crucial for cell function and viability. Knockdown experiments in human primary fibroblasts have shown that reducing ETV6 expression can decrease senescent cell load and increase splicing factor expression, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular senescence by regulating transcription of genes involved in this process (Latorre2018FOXO1). This regulatory function is part of a complex network involving multiple signaling pathways, including ERK and AKT, which are known to influence aging and senescence phenotypes (Latorre2018FOXO1).

## Clinical Significance
ETV6 mutations and alterations are implicated in a range of hematological disorders and cancers. Germline mutations in ETV6 are associated with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia, predisposing individuals to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These mutations often result in truncated proteins that may act in a dominant-negative fashion, disrupting normal hematopoiesis and increasing the risk of leukemia (Noetzli2015Germline; Rasighaemi2017ETV6). Somatic mutations, including deletions and translocations such as ETV6-NTRK3, are significant in the pathogenesis of various leukemias and solid tumors like congenital fibrosarcoma and secretory breast carcinoma (Zhou2018Acute).

Inherited mutations in ETV6, such as the W380R mutation, have been linked to inherited thrombocytopenia and secondary acute conditions like ALL and essential thrombocythemia, affecting the protein's DNA binding and localization, thus reducing its transcriptional repression activity (Kozubik2020Functional). Additionally, ETV6 deletions, particularly in childhood ALL, act as secondary events that further disrupt gene function, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor (Rasighaemi2017ETV6).

The clinical significance of ETV6 abnormalities extends to their impact on prognosis and treatment strategies in hematological malignancies, emphasizing the importance of genetic screening in affected patients (Rasighaemi2017ETV6).

## Interactions
ETV6, a transcription factor from the ETS family, engages in various physical interactions that modulate its function in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with nuclear corepressors such as mSin3a, N-CoR, and SMRT through its central domain, enhancing its transcriptional repressor activity. This interaction is crucial for its role in gene silencing (Putnik2007The). Additionally, ETV6 can dimerize with the ETS-family transcription factor FLI1, which results in the repression of FLI1's transcriptional activity, mediated through the pointed domain of ETV6 (Putnik2007The).

ETV6 also interacts with the HIV Tat interacting protein (TIP60), a histone acetyltransferase, which is mediated by a specific 63 amino acid region in ETV6. This interaction is essential for the acetylation of ETV6, influencing its transcriptional activities and potentially playing a role in leukemogenesis (Putnik2007The). The interaction domains between ETV6 and TIP60, particularly involving the TIP60 MYST domain and its zinc finger, suggest a complex regulatory mechanism where TIP60 may acetylate ETV6, causing a conformational change that facilitates further interactions (Putnik2007The).

In the context of DNA binding, ETV6 exhibits autoinhibition where an inhibitory helix blocks the DNA-binding interface, modulating its interaction with DNA. This mechanism is crucial for the dynamic regulation of ETV6's transcriptional activity, allowing it to respond to cellular signals and maintain proper gene expression levels (De2016Autoinhibition).
