# CDK7

## Overview
CDK7, or cyclin-dependent kinase 7, is a gene that encodes the protein kinase known as CDK7. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and transcription processes in eukaryotic cells. As a kinase, CDK7 phosphorylates several key proteins, including other cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which are essential for cell cycle progression and the initiation of transcription, respectively (Fisher2005Secrets; Sava2020CDK7). CDK7 is part of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, along with Cyclin H and MAT1, and is also a component of the general transcription factor complex TFIIH. The multifunctional nature of CDK7 underscores its importance in cellular function and organismal development, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, making it a target for therapeutic intervention (Li2017Therapeutic).

## Structure
The molecular structure of CDK7, a cyclin-dependent kinase, is characterized by a conserved central protein kinase domain, which is structurally similar to that of CDK2. This similarity is evidenced by a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.49 Ã over 262 equivalent CÎ± atoms when superimposed with CDK2 (Wood2018Structural). CDK7 is part of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which also includes Cyclin H and MAT1. The complex's structure reveals intricate interactions among these components, forming a tightly packed heterotrimeric complex (Peissert2020Structural).

In terms of activation and structural dynamics, the Î±-helix H3 of Cyclin H pushes the C-helix of CDK7 toward the active site. This positioning allows the formation of a salt bridge essential for the kinase's activity and facilitates magnesium binding crucial for ATP hydrolysis. The activation loop of CDK7 is stabilized through extensive interactions with MAT1 and Cyclin H, critical for its catalytic activity (Peissert2020Structural). Notably, the activation loop's position is maintained by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, involving residues from MAT1 and Cyclin H that interact with specific residues on CDK7 (Peissert2020Structural).

These structural insights into CDK7 highlight its unique activation mechanism and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer, where regulation of transcription and cell cycle are pivotal (Peissert2020Structural).

## Function
CDK7 (cyclin-dependent kinase 7) is a key regulator of cell cycle progression and transcription in human cells. As a component of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which also includes cyclin H and MAT1, CDK7 phosphorylates other cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) at specific threonine residues within their T-loops. This phosphorylation is crucial for the activation of CDKs such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, thereby facilitating cell cycle transitions, including the G1 phase and the entry into mitosis (Sava2020CDK7).

In addition to its role in cell cycle control, CDK7 is integral to transcription regulation. It is part of the general transcription factor complex TFIIH and is responsible for phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. This phosphorylation is essential for initiating transcription at gene promoters and is also involved in transcription elongation and termination processes (Fisher2005Secrets; Sava2020CDK7).

The multifunctional nature of CDK7, acting in both the cell cycle and transcription, underscores its importance in cellular function and organismal development. Disruptions in CDK7's activity can lead to various cellular dysfunctions and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, making it a target for anticancer drug development (Sava2020CDK7).

## Clinical Significance
CDK7 (cyclin-dependent kinase 7) has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and transcription. Elevated expression of CDK7 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In breast cancer, CDK7 expression levels are significantly upregulated, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where high expression correlates with reduced survival rates (Li2017Therapeutic; Tang2021Expression). Similarly, in NSCLC, higher CDK7 expression is generally noted in squamous cell carcinoma compared to adenocarcinoma, and is linked to worse survival outcomes (Kuempers2022CDK7).

Interestingly, in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, CDK7 overexpression is associated with a better prognosis, suggesting a subtype-specific role of CDK7 in breast cancer (Sava2020CDK7). This differential impact highlights the complexity of CDK7's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. CDK7 inhibitors, such as THZ1, have shown promise in preclinical studies, particularly in cancers with high CDK7 expression, by impairing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis (Li2017Therapeutic; Jagomast2022CDK7). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CDK7 in cancer, suggesting that targeting CDK7 could be a viable strategy for improving patient outcomes in specific cancer subtypes.

## Interactions
CDK7 forms a crucial part of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, interacting extensively with Cyclin H and MAT1. This interaction is vital for the activation and regulation of CDK7, where Cyclin H and MAT1 facilitate the positioning of the CDK7 T-loop in its active conformation, crucial for its kinase activity (Peissert2020Structural). Additionally, CDK7 is involved in phosphorylating other cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, with CDK1 and CDK2 also capable of phosphorylating CDK7 (Lolli2007Recognition). The interaction between CDK7 and CDK2 is consistent, involving key residues that are conserved across several Cdks, suggesting a common mechanism of interaction (Lolli2007Recognition).

CDK7 also interacts with the C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2), influencing its phosphorylation status and dimerization, which are crucial for CtBP2's activity and stability. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism that could impact cellular processes such as cancer cell migration (Wang2013Interaction). Furthermore, CDK7 is part of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, essential for transcription initiation and DNA repair, indicating its role in fundamental cellular processes beyond the cell cycle (Fisher2005Secrets).
