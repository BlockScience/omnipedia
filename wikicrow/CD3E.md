# CD3E

## Overview
The CD3E gene encodes the epsilon subunit of the CD3 complex, a crucial component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex found on T lymphocytes. This protein plays a vital role in the immune system by mediating signal transduction and T-cell activation through its interaction with other subunits of the CD3 complex and the TCR itself. The CD3 epsilon subunit is a transmembrane protein that, along with other CD3 subunits (CD3Î³, CD3Î´, and CD3Î¶), contributes to the assembly and expression of the TCR complex on the cell surface. Mutations in the CD3E gene can lead to severe immunodeficiencies, highlighting its importance in immune function and T-cell development (Firtina2017A; Kim2000Heterodimeric).

## Structure
The CD3E protein, a crucial component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, exhibits a well-defined molecular structure integral to its function in T-cell signaling. The primary structure of CD3E consists of a sequence of amino acids forming various domains essential for its activity. The secondary structure includes multiple Î²-strands organized into antiparallel Î²-sheets, a characteristic feature of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Specifically, the CD3E protein in its heterodimeric form with CD3G, known as CD3ÎµÎ³, comprises Î² sheets arranged in a butterfly-like pattern, with a total of seven Î² strands organized into two Î² sheets linked by a disulfide bridge (Sun2001Mechanisms).

In terms of tertiary structure, the CD3E protein adopts an Ig fold, which is typical for members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This fold is crucial for the protein's stability and interaction with other components of the TCR complex (Arnett2004Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with other CD3 subunits, such as CD3G and CD3D, which are essential for the assembly and surface expression of the TCR complex (Kuhns2006DeconstructingTF).

Post-translational modifications of CD3E, although not detailed in the provided contexts, typically include phosphorylation, which plays a critical role in signal transduction within the TCR pathway. The structural and functional integrity of CD3E is pivotal for T-cell activation and response, underscoring its significance in the immune response.

## Function
The CD3E gene encodes the epsilon subunit of the CD3 complex, a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex on T lymphocytes. This complex is essential for TCR signaling, which is pivotal for T-cell development, activation, and function. The CD3E protein, along with other CD3 subunits (CD3g, CD3d, and CD3z), mediates signal transduction through the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) present in their cytoplasmic domains. Upon antigen recognition, these motifs interact with intracellular signaling factors, leading to protein tyrosine phosphorylation that triggers T-cell activation (Kim2000Heterodimeric; Chen2010Gene).

CD3E is also crucial for the cell surface expression of the TCR complex on mature T lymphocytes and for pre-TCR function on immature thymocytes. In the absence of CD3E expression, there is a significant reduction or absence of TCR molecules on the cell surface, which is demonstrated by in vitro analysis and genetically engineered mouse models. These models show a developmental blockade of thymocytes at the double negative stage, underscoring the critical role of CD3E in T cell maturation (Kim2000Heterodimeric).

Furthermore, mutations in CD3E can lead to severe immunodeficiencies. For instance, a frameshift mutation resulting in a premature stop codon leads to the loss of CD3E protein through nonsense-mediated decay, impairing the formation of the CD3/TCR complex and severely affecting T cell responses (Firtina2017A). This highlights the importance of CD3E in immune function and its role in preventing severe clinical outcomes associated with T cell deficiencies.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD3E gene, which encodes the CD3 epsilon subunit of the T-cell receptor complex, are associated with several immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is characterized by a profound deficiency in T-cell development, leading to a compromised immune system that is highly susceptible to infections. Specific mutations in CD3E can result in different phenotypes of SCID, often categorized based on the presence or absence of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. For instance, homozygous mutations or deletions in CD3E can lead to T-B+ NK+ SCID, where patients have normal B cell and NK cell numbers but severely reduced or absent T cells (Firtina2017A; Basile2004Severe).

The clinical manifestations of CD3E mutations include typical SCID features such as pneumonia, oral candidiasis, and acute respiratory distress, as well as other symptoms like fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and respiratory infections (Firtina2017A; Setia2021Novel). The absence of the CD3Îµ protein, due to mutations leading to premature stop codons, prevents the expression of the protein necessary for T cell development and signaling, underscoring the critical role of CD3Îµ in immune function (Basile2004Severe).

These genetic alterations in CD3E not only lead to severe immunodeficiency but also increase the risk of autoimmune conditions, as the immune system fails to develop properly and regulate itself effectively. Early diagnosis and interventions, such as bone marrow transplantation, are crucial for managing the condition and improving outcomes (Firtina2017A).

## Interactions
CD3E, as part of the CD3 complex, plays a pivotal role in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and assembly. It forms stable heterodimers with CD3Î³ and CD3Î´, which are essential for the surface expression of the TCR on mature T lymphocytes and for the function of the pre-TCR in precursor thymocytes (Call2005THE; Sun2001Mechanisms). These interactions are mediated through the transmembrane regions containing charged residues, suggesting a mechanism involving ionic interactions similar to salt bridges (Call2005THE).

The CD3E protein also interacts with the TCR Î² chain, where it is part of the docking site identified by solution NMR studies. This interaction involves approximately 9-11 solvent-accessible residues at the base of the TCR, mainly forming a hydrophilic patch, which is crucial for the function of the TCR-CD3 complex in T cell signaling (He2015Identification). Additionally, CD3E is involved in cooperative binding mechanisms with CD3ÎµÎ´ and CD3ÎµÎ³ to the TCR, enhancing the chemical shift changes in NMR, indicating interaction (He2015Identification).

Furthermore, CD3E participates in specific interactions within the TCR complex, forming stable associations with other CD3 chains such as CD3-Î´ and CD3-Î³, which are critical for the structural integrity and function of the TCR complex (Manolios1991Pairwise). These interactions are characterized by cooperative, competitive, and inhibitory dynamics, which are essential for the proper assembly and function of the TCR complex (Manolios1991Pairwise).
