# FBXO2

## Overview
FBXO2, or F-box only protein 2, is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 2, a component of the SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex involved in protein degradation. The protein is characterized by an F-box motif essential for protein-protein interactions and a substrate-binding domain that recognizes specific glycoproteins, particularly those with high-mannose N-linked glycosylation. FBXO2 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including protein quality control, signal transduction, and immune responses by targeting misfolded or excess proteins for degradation. Its function is crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has implications in disease states such as cancer and viral infections (Che2020FBXO2; Zhao2020FBXO2).

## Structure
FBXO2, or F-box protein 2, is a member of the F-box protein family characterized by an F-box motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions within the SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. The molecular structure of FBXO2 includes several distinct domains crucial for its function. The F-box domain is responsible for binding to SKP1, a core component of the SCF complex, which is essential for the ubiquitination process (Zhang2018Epstein-Barr; Glenn2008Diversity). Additionally, FBXO2 features a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD), also referred to as the sugar-binding domain, which recognizes sugar moieties on glycoprotein substrates (Zhang2018Epstein-Barr).

A notable structural feature of FBXO2 is the F-box associated (FBA) domain, which specifically binds high-mannose N-linked glycoproteins. This domain is critical for the protein's role in targeting misfolded glycoproteins for proteasomal degradation (Nelson2007Selective; Glenn2008Diversity). The FBA domain's ability to recognize glycosylated proteins is dependent on a hydrophobic pocket formed by two consecutive amino acids, tyrosine (Tyr-278) and tryptophan (Trp-279), which are essential for glycoprotein binding (Glenn2008Diversity).

While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of FBXO2 are not detailed in the available literature, these domains and structural features highlight the protein's complex functionality in cellular processes. Additionally, no specific information on common post-translational modifications, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms is provided in the cited excerpts.

## Function
FBXO2, or F-box only protein 2, is a member of the F-box protein family, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This pathway is essential for various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and gene expression. FBXO2 functions as a substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Zhao2020FBXO2).

FBXO2 has a unique role in recognizing high-mannose glycoproteins due to its F-box associated region (FBA) domain. This glycoprotein recognition is crucial for its function, as deletion or mutation of the FBA domain abolishes this capability (Zhao2020FBXO2). The protein is involved in the ubiquitination of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glycoproteins as part of the ER-associated degradation system, which is vital for maintaining cellular protein quality control by targeting misfolded or excess proteins for degradation (Che2020FBXO2).

Additionally, FBXO2 interacts with the insulin receptor to enhance its ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. This interaction influences the integrity of insulin signaling pathways, highlighting FBXO2's role in cellular processes through the modulation of protein stability and signaling pathways (Zhao2020FBXO2). FBXO2 also promotes the degradation of Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein, thereby decreasing the entry of the virus into cells, which suggests its involvement in the immune response against viral infections (Zhang2018Epstein-Barr).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO2, or F-box protein 2, has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers, demonstrating its clinical significance. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FBXO2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation, often due to SKP2-mediated ubiquitination, correlates with increased tumor growth and metastasis, particularly by stabilizing Hsp47, a promoter of metastasis (Xue2024SKP2-mediated). Conversely, in ovarian cancer, endometrial carcinoma, and osteosarcoma, FBXO2 functions differently, promoting tumor progression by targeting various proteins for degradation. For instance, in ovarian cancer, FBXO2 targets the glycosylated SUN2 protein, and in endometrial carcinoma, it targets Fibrillin1 (FBN1), both leading to increased cancer cell proliferation and poor prognosis (Ji2022FBXO2; Che2020FBXO2).

Furthermore, FBXO2's role extends beyond cancer. A variant of FBXO2 has been associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease in the Han Chinese population, suggesting its protective role in neurological conditions (Che2020FBXO2). These findings underscore the diverse implications of FBXO2 in human health and disease, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
FBXO2, a member of the F-box protein family, interacts with various proteins, influencing cellular processes through its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. It specifically binds to the FBN1 protein through its C-terminal F-box associated (FBA) domain, leading to FBN1's polyubiquitination and degradation, which is crucial for regulating cell cycle and autophagy pathways in endometrial cancer cells (Che2020FBXO2). Additionally, FBXO2 targets glycosylated forms of the SUN2 protein, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby playing a role in ovarian cancer development (Ji2022FBXO2). 

In the context of viral infections, FBXO2 interacts with Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein B (gB), recognizing high-mannose glycans on gB and targeting it for degradation, which limits viral infectivity (Zhang2018Epstein-Barr). Furthermore, FBXO2 is involved in the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway by interacting with the Interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R), enhancing IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, which is significant in osteosarcoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity (Zhao2020FBXO2). These interactions underline FBXO2's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and disease progression.
