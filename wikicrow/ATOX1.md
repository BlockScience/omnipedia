# ATOX1

## Overview
ATOX1 is a gene in humans that encodes the protein antioxidant 1 copper chaperone (ATOX1). This protein is crucial for copper homeostasis in the cell, primarily functioning as a metallochaperone that transports copper ions to P1B-type ATPases in the Golgi apparatus. These ATPases, such as ATP7A and ATP7B, are essential for the incorporation of copper into various copper-dependent enzymes, which are vital for numerous biological processes including cellular respiration and enzyme activation. Beyond its role in copper transport, ATOX1 also acts as a copper-dependent transcription factor, influencing gene expression related to cell cycle progression and proliferation. The protein's ability to interact with the cellular redox environment further underscores its role in maintaining cellular health and managing oxidative stress (Itoh2008Novel; OâHalloran2000Metallochaperones; Matson2016Extended).

## Structure
The human ATOX1 protein consists of 68 amino acids and exhibits a molecular weight of approximately 7.4 kDa. It is characterized by a ferredoxin-like fold, which includes a specific arrangement of secondary structure elements: Î²1, Î±1, Î²2, Î²3, Î±2, Î²4. This fold is highly conserved among metallochaperones and soluble domains of Cu-ATPases (Nardella2019Oxidation; Rodriguez-Granillo2009Differential).

The secondary structure of ATOX1 is described as a Î²Î±Î²Î²Î±Î² fold, crucial for its function as a metallochaperone. This structure facilitates the coordination of a Cu(I) ion using the cysteine residues of a conserved MxCxxC motif (Perkal2020Cu(I; Levy2014Probing) page 3 of 5). The tertiary structure of ATOX1 is similar to that of the metal-binding domains found in the ATP7A/B copper pumps, which also bind a single copper atom in vitro (Levy2014Probing).

ATOX1 can exist in multiple conformational states, including at least four in the apo state (unbound to copper) and two in the holo state (bound to copper). The holo form is more compact than the apo form. Additionally, ATOX1 is capable of forming a dimeric state, which is biologically active and interacts with partner proteins in the cell. This dimeric state involves a coordination state of four, which differs from the monomeric form (Perkal2020Cu(I; Levy2017The) page 3 of 5).

## Function
ATOX1, also known as antioxidant 1 copper chaperone, plays a critical role in copper homeostasis within human cells by functioning as a copper chaperone. It specifically shuttles copper ions to P1B-type ATPases, such as ATP7A and ATP7B, located in the Golgi network. These ATPases are responsible for incorporating copper into various copper-dependent enzymes that follow the secretory pathway, which is essential for numerous biochemical processes including enzyme activation and cellular respiration (OâHalloran2000Metallochaperones; Matson2016Extended).

In addition to its role in copper transport, ATOX1 has been identified as a copper-dependent transcription factor. It is activated by copper, leading to its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA elements, such as the cyclin D1 promoter. This interaction facilitates the transcription of genes crucial for cell cycle progression and proliferation, demonstrating its integral role in cell biology beyond mere copper transport (Itoh2008Novel).

Furthermore, ATOX1 contributes to the antioxidant defense of cells. It interacts with the cellular redox environment, particularly through its relationship with glutathione levels, positioning it at a critical junction of cellular networks that manage copper distribution and cellular redox balance (Hatori2013An). This multifaceted role underscores the importance of ATOX1 in maintaining cellular health and preventing the toxic buildup of copper, thereby ensuring proper cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATOX1 gene can lead to severe physiological abnormalities and developmental disorders due to disrupted copper homeostasis. In mice, Atox1 null alleles result in perinatal mortality, growth retardation, and various congenital defects, suggesting a critical role of ATOX1 in early development and physiological function (Hamza2001The). Additionally, mutations in ATOX1 have been implicated in modifying the clinical presentation of Wilson disease, a genetic disorder characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the body. Novel variants in ATOX1, such as p.(Gly14Ser), have been associated with early onset age, reduced serum ceruloplasmin levels, and severe liver and brain symptoms in affected individuals (Kumari2019In-silico).

Alterations in ATOX1 expression are also significant in cancer biology. Elevated ATOX1 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer and melanoma. In melanoma, particularly in cases with BRAF mutations, ATOX1 overexpression is linked to enhanced tumor growth and metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Kim2019Copper; Shanbhag2021Copper). These findings underscore the importance of ATOX1 in both normal physiological processes and disease pathogenesis, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in diseases caused by its dysregulation.

## Interactions
ATOX1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a crucial role in copper homeostasis and potentially influencing other cellular processes. It forms stable copper-bridged heterodimer complexes with all six metal binding domains of ATP7B, a key interaction for regulating the copper occupancy of ATP7B, which in turn affects ATP7B's intracellular localization, post-translational modifications, and catalytic activity (Kumari2019In-silico). Additionally, ATOX1 has been shown to interact with ATP7A, another copper-transporting ATPase, facilitating copper transfer in the secretory pathway (Matson2018Copper).

Beyond its role in copper transport, ATOX1 interacts with various subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), including APC1, APC3, and APC7, as demonstrated using proximity ligation assays in HEK293T cells. These interactions suggest a potential role in cell cycle regulation (Matson2018Copper). Furthermore, ATOX1 has been implicated in nuclear functions, potentially acting as a copper-dependent transcription factor influencing gene expression, although direct DNA binding has not been observed in vitro (Ãhrvik2015Identification).

These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of ATOX1, extending beyond mere copper transport to potentially influencing gene regulation and cell cycle processes.
