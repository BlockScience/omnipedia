# STMN1

## Overview
STMN1 is a gene that encodes the protein stathmin 1, a critical regulator of microtubule dynamics in cells. Stathmin 1 is primarily known for its role in destabilizing microtubules, which are key components of the cell's cytoskeleton involved in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The protein is characterized by its rapid turnover and high solubility, functioning as a tubulin-sequestering protein in its unphosphorylated state and as a promoter of microtubule depolymerization. Stathmin 1's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which modulates its interaction with tubulin and its ability to control microtubule dynamics, crucial during processes such as mitosis and cell signaling (Rubin2004The; Rana2008Stathmin). The gene's expression and the protein's function have been implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zhang2022STMN1).

## Structure
Stathmin 1 (STMN1) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein primarily involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. The protein is composed of 149 amino acids and is characterized by a primary structure rich in polar and small residues such as Gln, Asn, Ser, Pro, Glu, Lys, Gly, and Ala, typical of intrinsically disordered proteins (Steinmetz2007Structure). It has a low content of bulky hydrophobic amino acids, which contributes to its lack of a stable tertiary structure when isolated. 

The secondary structure of STMN1 includes a relatively unstructured N-terminus and a helical C-terminal domain. This C-terminal domain contains heptad repeats indicative of alpha-helical coiled-coil interactions (Steinmetz2007Structure). The protein undergoes significant post-translational modifications, notably multisite phosphorylation at serine residues Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63. These modifications are crucial for regulating STMN1's interaction with tubulin and its function in microtubule dynamics (Magron2015The; Steinmetz2007Structure).

STMN1 lacks a well-defined tertiary structure in isolation, but it forms a significant structural relationship with tubulin, influencing microtubule dynamics. The interaction involves a core region necessary for tubulin binding, which includes an N-terminal or C-terminal extension (Rana2008Stathmin). STMN1 does not exhibit a quaternary structure as it is monomeric in solution (Steinmetz2007Structure).

Additionally, STMN1 has several splice variant isoforms, mostly expressed in the nervous system, which include superior cervical ganglion-10 (SCG10 or STMN2), SCG10-like protein (SCLIP or STMN3), and stathmin-like protein B3 (RB3 or STMN4) (Magron2015The). These variants share the core functional themes of the STMN1 protein but are differentiated by slight variations in their amino acid sequence and function.

## Function
STMN1, also known as stathmin 1, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which are integral components of the cell's cytoskeleton involved in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The primary function of the STMN1 protein is to destabilize microtubules by promoting their depolymerization. This activity is essential during cell division, particularly in the formation and function of the mitotic spindle necessary for chromosome segregation (Rubin2004The).

The activity of STMN1 is intricately regulated by phosphorylation. During the early stages of mitosis, phosphorylation inhibits the depolymerizing activity of STMN1, allowing microtubules to polymerize and assemble into the mitotic spindle. This regulation ensures proper chromosome alignment and segregation, which are critical for cell division (Rubin2004The; Rana2008Stathmin). Post-mitosis, dephosphorylation of STMN1 reactivates its depolymerizing function, facilitating the disassembly of the spindle and exit from mitosis (Rubin2004The).

Furthermore, STMN1 interacts with other cellular proteins and is involved in various cellular processes beyond mitosis, including cell motility and intracellular transport, underscoring its broader significance in cell biology (Rana2008Stathmin). Disruptions in STMN1 function, such as through mutations or altered expression levels, can lead to abnormal cell cycle progression and are implicated in various diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Aronova2017STMN1).

## Clinical Significance
STMN1 (stathmin 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in microtubule dynamics, which are crucial for cell cycle progression and mitosis. Overexpression of STMN1 has been consistently associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and gastric cancer. In HCC, STMN1 overexpression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics such as larger tumor size, higher tumor grade, and increased vascular invasion, significantly lowering 5-year survival rates (Zhang2022STMN1; Yuan2006Stathmin). Similarly, in PDAC, STMN1 is significantly up-regulated compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, correlating with poor histological differentiation, lymphatic metastasis, and advanced TNM stage (Li2015Elevated). 

In gastric cancer, STMN1 expression is linked to deeper invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced pathological TNM stage, suggesting its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in cancer metastasis (Kang2012Stathmin1; Ke2018Clinical). The gene's overexpression is also associated with resistance to chemotherapy, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022STMN1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of STMN1 as a biomarker for prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various malignancies.

## Interactions
STMN1 (stathmin 1) interacts with various proteins, influencing cell dynamics and cancer progression. It forms a ternary complex with tubulin heterodimers, inhibiting microtubule polymerization and enhancing depolymerization, crucial for regulating microtubule dynamics (Rubin2004The). STMN1 is phosphorylated at S16 by the Rac1--Pak1 pathway, which is essential for microtubule dynamics during cell migration (Belletti2011Stathmin:). Additionally, it interacts with p27 kip1 and STAT3; the latter binds to STMN1 and inhibits its tubulin depolymerization activity, stabilizing microtubules necessary for cell migration (Belletti2011Stathmin:).

In cancer contexts, STMN1's interaction with proteins like Heat shock protein HSP70b, TSG101, and KIS kinase suggests its role in various cellular processes beyond microtubule dynamics (Belletti2011Stathmin:). STMN1 also interacts with the FANCC protein, with mutations in FANCC disrupting this interaction, which is significant for the regulation of STMN1 phosphorylation and mitotic spindle assembly (Magron2015The).

Furthermore, STMN1's phosphorylation at Ser25 and Ser38 is crucial for its interaction with the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a relationship that plays a significant role in breast cancer metastasis (Kuang2016The). This interaction highlights the importance of STMN1's phosphorylation states in its functional partnerships and influence on disease progression.
