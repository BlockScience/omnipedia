# PLAU

## Overview
The PLAU gene encodes the protein plasminogen activator, urokinase (uPA), which is a serine protease involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the basement membrane. This protein plays a pivotal role in biological processes such as tissue remodeling, wound healing, and thrombolysis. The uPA protein is characterized by a kringle domain, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules, including fibrin and receptors on the cell surface. These interactions facilitate localized proteolytic activity essential for cellular migration, proliferation, and tissue regeneration. The gene and its protein product are also significant in clinical contexts, being implicated in various pathological conditions including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and several types of cancer, where they influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Ertekin-Taner2004Elevated; Chen2021PLAU).

## Structure
The PLAU protein, encoded by the PLAU gene, includes a kringle domain, which is a common structural motif in proteins that bind other molecules. This domain is specifically located at the junction between two beta-pleated sheets, which are elements of the protein's secondary structure (Ertekin-Taner2004Elevated). The kringle domain in PLAU is particularly significant as it undergoes a proline to leucine change at position 141 due to the rs2227564 SNP, affecting the protein's function, such as its binding efficiency to fibrin aggregates (Ertekin-Taner2004Elevated; Xu2010Association).

The primary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the PLAU protein, as well as other specific domains, prominent folds, common post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms, are not detailed in the provided excerpts. Therefore, information on these aspects of the molecular structure of PLAU cannot be provided based on the available context.

In summary, the PLAU protein structure is characterized by a kringle domain crucial for its function, particularly influenced by genetic variations that can alter its binding properties and overall functionality (Ertekin-Taner2004Elevated; Xu2010Association).

## Function
The PLAU gene encodes the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix in healthy human cells. This enzymatic activity is essential for processes such as tissue remodeling and wound healing. uPA converts plasminogen to plasmin, a broad-spectrum protease that facilitates the breakdown of fibrin, thereby aiding in the resolution of blood clots and the remodeling of tissues necessary for healing processes (Chen2021PLAU).

In cell biology, uPA is involved in modulating cell migration and proliferation, impacting critical physiological processes including angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. The activity of uPA is regulated in part by its interaction with specific receptors on the cell surface, which localizes its proteolytic activity to the vicinity of the cell, thus coordinating localized tissue remodeling (Yang2019Identification).

Moreover, PLAU, along with its physiological inhibitor SERPINE1, regulates the adhesion and deadhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. This balance influences tissue dynamics and cellular interactions, which are vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of tissues (Yang2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLAU gene, which encodes urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), have been linked to various diseases and conditions, primarily through their role in fibrinolysis, tissue remodeling, and cell migration. Notably, the rs4065 variant in the 3'-UTR of PLAU has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction in the Chinese Han population, as well as other conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, mitral valve prolapse, urolithiasis, atopy, and Alzheimer's disease (Xu2010Association). Another variant, rs2227564 (Pro141Leu), affects the kringle domain of uPA and has been linked to diseases such as asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and colorectal cancer (Duran2014The).

Furthermore, heterozygous tandem duplications of PLAU cause autosomal dominant Quebec platelet disorder, characterized by a gain-of-function defect in fibrinolysis (Gaweda-Walerych2021Two). A loss-of-function variant (c.366C>A; p.Cys122*) has been identified in a patient with semantic dementia, marking the first reported case of PLAU haploinsufficiency in humans (Gaweda-Walerych2021Two). This variant leads to reduced mRNA and protein levels of PLAU, impacting cognitive functions and demonstrating the gene's crucial role in neurological health (Gaweda-Walerych2021Two). Additionally, PLAU has been implicated in various cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis (Zhao2020Triptolide; Chen2021PLAU).

## Interactions
PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokinase) interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, PLAU interacts with PSMC2 (Proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 2), where PSMC2 regulates the stability and expression of PLAU through ubiquitination mechanisms. This interaction suggests that PSMC2 may influence PLAU's signaling pathways, impacting cancer progression and metastasis (Wang2021Overexpression).

In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PLAU is a target of the compound triptolide derived from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. The inhibition of PLAU by triptolide affects the biological behavior of pancreatic cancer cells, indicating the functional importance of PLAU's interactions in cancer progression (Zhao2020Triptolide).

Additionally, in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), PLAU is significantly correlated with several genes such as C10orf55, ITGA5, SERPINE1, and TNFRSF12A. These interactions are crucial for processes like cell-substrate adhesion and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), essential for tumor invasion and metastasis (Chen2021PLAU).
