# DIRAS3

## Overview
DIRAS3 is a gene that encodes the protein DIRAS family GTPase 3, a member of the DIRAS family of small GTPases within the RAS superfamily. Unlike most RAS family proteins, which typically function as oncogenes, DIRAS3 acts as a tumor suppressor. The protein is characterized by a unique 34-amino acid N-terminal extension not found in other Ras proteins, which is crucial for its growth inhibitory function. This protein is involved in various cellular processes including cell cycle control, autophagy, and cellular motility, playing a significant role in maintaining normal cell function and preventing tumor development. The gene's expression is notably altered in several cancers, such as ovarian and breast cancers, where its downregulation is associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis (Li2018The; Nishimoto2005A; Luo2003ARHI).

## Structure
DIRAS3, also known as ARHI, encodes a protein that is part of the DIRAS family of small GTPases within the RAS superfamily. The protein is characterized by a unique 34-amino acid N-terminal extension that is crucial for its growth inhibitory function and distinguishes it from other members of the Ras family (Li2018The; Sutton2019DIRAS3). This N-terminal extension is suggested to contain a single alpha-helix, which is vital for the protein's ability to inhibit cell growth (Luo2003ARHI).

The primary structure of DIRAS3 includes five highly conserved domains (G1-G5) essential for GTP binding and hydrolysis, which are typical features of the Ras proteins. Additionally, DIRAS3 contains a CAAX box at the carboxyl terminus for membrane localization, crucial for its function (Li2018The). The protein exhibits low intrinsic GTPase activity and unique Mg2+ dependency for GTP binding, influenced by sequence divergence in the G3 domain (Luo2003ARHI).

DIRAS3 undergoes post-translational prenylation at the C-terminal cysteine residue, which is essential for its association with the cell membrane and its function as a tumor suppressor (Luo2003ARHI). The specific domains and prominent folds within DIRAS3, including its unique structural features, contribute to its role in modulating interactions with other proteins and its activity within signaling pathways, distinct from the oncogenic functions seen in other RAS family members.

## Function
DIRAS3, also known as ARHI, is a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene that encodes a 26-kDa GTPase protein, which is a member of the Ras superfamily of small G proteins. This protein is unique among Ras family members due to its role as a tumor suppressor rather than an oncogene. DIRAS3 is constitutively activated in its GTP-bound form due to specific sequence differences that impair its GTPase activity, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that does not rely on the typical GTP/GDP cycle but rather on the modulation of its protein expression levels (Yu2006Biochemistry; Lu2006Transcriptional).

In healthy cells, DIRAS3 plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes including cell cycle control, autophagy, and motility. It is involved in vesicular trafficking, nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking, spindle microtubule assembly, and cytoskeletal rearrangements (Lu2006Transcriptional). The protein's unique NH2-terminal extension, not found in other Ras proteins, is essential for its suppressive function, which includes the inhibition of cell proliferation and motility (Nishimoto2005A).

DIRAS3 is also implicated in maintaining tumor dormancy and inhibiting cancer cell growth, highlighting its integral role in preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor development (Nowak2017DNA). Its expression is frequently lost or down-regulated in ovarian and breast cancers, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential impact on cancer suppression (Nishimoto2005A).

## Clinical Significance
DIRAS3, also known as ARHI, is implicated in several cancers, including ovarian, breast, and gliomas, where its expression levels and interactions play crucial roles in disease progression and patient prognosis. In ovarian and breast cancers, DIRAS3 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, and its loss or downregulation is frequently observed. This downregulation is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior and poorer prognosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker for these cancers (Li2018The; Lu2008The).

In gliomas, however, DIRAS3 exhibits a contrasting behavior. While typically acting as a tumor suppressor in other cancers, in gliomas, it is up-regulated and correlates with poor prognosis, promoting malignant phenotypes and enhancing cell proliferation and invasion through the EGFR-AKT signaling pathway (Peng2018Oncogenic). This suggests that DIRAS3 might serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioma treatment.

Furthermore, DIRAS3's interaction with STAT3, a transcription factor often activated in cancers, is significant. By inhibiting STAT3 activity, DIRAS3 prevents STAT3 from accumulating in the nucleus and binding to DNA, thereby reducing STAT3-dependent promoter activity and affecting cell proliferation and survival (Nishimoto2005A). This interaction highlights the gene's role in modulating key pathways involved in cancer progression.

## Interactions
DIRAS3, also known as ARHI, is a small GTPase that interacts directly with the K-RAS protein, playing a significant role in inhibiting the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction primarily occurs at the plasma membrane where DIRAS3 binds to the A5 helical domain of K-RAS, disrupting RAS clustering and thereby inhibiting downstream signaling crucial for tumor growth and proliferation (Sutton2019DIRAS3). The interaction between DIRAS3 and K-RAS is further characterized by the ability of DIRAS3 to decrease RAS clustering and the association of RAS with B-Raf, which are essential for activating downstream signaling pathways (Sutton2019DIRAS3).

Additionally, DIRAS3 interacts with C-RAF, another component of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. This interaction, which occurs both in vivo and in vitro, is independent of nucleotides, suggesting that DIRAS3 can bind to C-RAF regardless of its nucleotide-bound state. This binding leads to the inhibition of the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, further influencing cell behavior related to migration and proliferation (Klingauf2012The).

These interactions highlight DIRAS3's role as a tumor suppressor, influencing critical signaling pathways and cellular processes involved in cancer progression.
