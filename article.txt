== Function ==
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ATP-binding cassette]] (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). The ABCC11 transporter is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance. The product of this gene participates in physiological processes involving bile acids, conjugated steroids, and cyclic nucleotides. In addition, a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) in this gene is responsible for determination of human [[earwax]] type and presence of underarm odour. This gene and family member [[ABCC12]] are determined to be derived by duplication and are both localized to chromosome 16q12.1. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene.<ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ABCC11 ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 11| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=85320}}</ref>

The ''ABCC11'' [[gene]] is present in the [[human genome]] as two [[allele]]s, differing in one [[nucleotide]] also known as a [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)]].<ref name="Toyoda_2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Toyoda Y, Sakurai A, Mitani Y, Nakashima M, Yoshiura K, Nakagawa H, Sakai Y, Ota I, Lezhava A, Hayashizaki Y, Niikawa N, Ishikawa T | title = Earwax, osmidrosis, and breast cancer: why does one SNP (538G>A) in the human ABC transporter ABCC11 gene determine earwax type? | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 2001–13 | date = Jun 2009 | pmid = 19383836 | doi = 10.1096/fj.09-129098 | doi-access = free | s2cid = 26853548 }}</ref> A SNP in the ''ABCC11'' gene on [[Chromosome 16 (human)|chromosome 16]] at [[Nucleobase|base]] position 538 of either a [[guanine]] or [[adenine]] determines two distinct groups of [[phenotype]]s.<ref name="Toyoda_2009" /><ref name="Yoshiura_2006" /> These respectively code for [[glycine]] and [[arginine]] in the gene's [[protein]] product. [[Heredity|Dominant inheritance]] of the GG or GA [[genotype]] is observed while the AA genotype is recessive. The phenotypes expressed by the genotypes include [[Earwax|cerumen]] type (wet or dry ear wax), [[osmidrosis]] (odor associated with [[Perspiration|sweat]] caused by excessive [[apocrine]] secretion), and possibly [[breast cancer]] risk, although there is ongoing debate on whether there is a real correlation of the wet ear wax phenotype to breast cancer susceptibility.<ref name="Rodriguez_2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez S, Steer CD, Farrow A, Golding J, Day IN | title = Dependence of deodorant usage on ABCC11 genotype: scope for personalized genetics in personal hygiene | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 133 | issue = 7 | pages = 1760–7 | date = Jul 2013 | pmid = 23325016 | pmc = 3674910 | doi = 10.1038/jid.2012.480 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Park YJ, Shin MS | title = What is the best method for treating osmidrosis? | journal = Annals of Plastic Surgery | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–9 | date = Sep 2001 | pmid = 11562036 | doi=10.1097/00000637-200109000-00014| s2cid = 25590802 }}</ref> The GG or GA genotype produces the wet ear wax phenotype (sticky and brown colored) and acrid sweat odor and is the dominant allele.<ref name="Rodriguez_2013"/> Note this phenotype requires only the presence of one guanine. The [[homozygous]] recessive AA genotype produces the dry ear wax phenotype (dry and flaky) and mildly odored sweat.<ref name="Rodriguez_2013" />

The alleles containing a guanine produce a protein that is [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] but alleles containing an adenine are not glycosylated. The resulting protein is only partially degraded by [[proteasome]]s.<ref name="Toyoda_2009"/> This effect is localized to [[ceruminous gland]] membranes.<ref name="Toyoda_2009" /> Because the adenine containing allele protein product is only partially degraded, the remaining functional protein is located on the cell surface membrane which ''ABCC11'' gene's role in sweat odor is likely in part due to the quantitative dosage of ABCC11 protein.<ref name="Toyoda_2009" />

From an [[evolution]]ary perspective, the implications of cerumen type on [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] are unknown. However, odorless sweat in ancient Northern [[Eurasia]]n populations has been postulated to have an [[Adaptation|adaptive]] advantage for cold weather.<ref name="Yoshiura_2006" /> In some nonhuman [[mammal]]s, [[mating]] signals via release of an odor enhanced by increased apocrine secretion may be a factor in [[sexual selection]].<ref name="Yoshiura_2006" />

Physical [[human]] traits that are controlled by a single gene are [[Human genetics#Human traits with simple inheritance patterns|uncommon]]. Most human characteristics are controlled by multiple genes ([[polygene]]s); ''ABCC11'' is a peculiar example of a gene with unambiguous phenotypes that is controlled by a SNP. Additionally, it is considered a [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] gene.

The history of the migration of humans can be traced back using the ''ABCC11'' gene alleles.

An analysis of [[ancient DNA]] of [[Eastern Hunter Gatherers|Eastern European hunter gatherers]], [[Scandinavian Hunter Gatherers]], [[Western Hunter Gatherers]] and [[Early European Farmers]]. The study found that the derived allele of ABCC11 associated with dry earwax and reduced body odor was absent in all European hunter gatherers, except for a [[Western Hunter Gatherer]]  from [[Mesolithic]] central Europe. The derived allele was absent in the paleolithic hunter gatherer [[Kostyonki–Borshchyovo#Human remains|Kostenki 14]], who is deeply related to [[Ancient North Eurasians]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Günther |first1=T |last2=Malmström |first2=H |last3=Svensson |first3=EM |title=Population genomics of Mesolithic Scandinavia: Investigating early postglacial migration routes and high-latitude adaptation. |journal=PLOS Biology |date=January 2018 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=e2003703 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003703 |pmid=29315301 |pmc=5760011 |doi-access=free }} From [https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?type=supplementary&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003703.s013 Supporting Information file S8], page 17/28: "Furthermore, SF9, SBj, Hum2 and SF12 as well as all other HG tested (with the exception of KO1), carried allelic variants at ABCC1 gene associated with wet earwax, normal body odor and normal

The frequency of alleles for dry ear wax is most concentrated in [[East Asia]]; most notably [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Mongolia]]. The allele frequency is highest among the northern [[Han Chinese]] and [[Koreans]]; followed by [[Mongols]], southern Han Chinese, and [[Yamato people|Yamato Japanese]], respectively.

The amount of [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) in ear wax was found to be related to variation in ABCC11 [[genotype]], which in turn is dependent on ethnic origin.  In particular, the rs17822931 genotype, which is especially prevalent in East Asians, is correlated with lower VOC levels. However, VOC levels were not found to vary significantly qualitatively nor quantitatively for most organic compounds by racial group after [[Bonferroni correction]]s, suggesting that it does not result in ethnic differences.<ref name="pmid26634572">{{cite journal | vauthors = Prokop-Prigge KA, Greene K, Varallo L, Wysocki CJ, Preti G | title = The Effect of Ethnicity on Human Axillary Odorant Production | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–9 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26634572 | pmc = 4724538 | doi = 10.1007/s10886-015-0657-8 | bibcode = 2016JCEco..42...33P }}</ref>
