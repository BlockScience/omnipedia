Mediated by adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1 receptors, this polypeptide stimulates [[adenylate cyclase]] and subsequently increases the [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] level in target cells. Adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1 not only is a hypophysiotropic hormone (i.e. a substance that induces activity in the [[pituitary gland|hypophysis]]), but also functions as a [[neurotransmitter]] and [[neuromodulation|neuromodulator]]. In addition, it plays a role in [[paracrine]] and [[autocrine]] regulation of certain types of cells. This gene has five [[exon]]s. Exons 1 and 2 encode the [[5' UTR]] and [[signal peptide]], respectively; exon 4 encodes an adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1-related peptide; and exon 5 encodes the mature peptide and [[3' UTR]]. This gene encodes three different mature peptides, including two isotypes: a shorter form and a longer form.&lt;ref name=&quot;entrez&quot;/&gt;</p>\n<p>A version of this gene has been associated with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) in women (but not men).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ressler 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ressler KJ, Mercer KB, Bradley B, Jovanovic T, Mahan A, Kerley K, Norrholm SD, Kilaru V, Smith AK, Myers AJ, Ramirez M, Engel A, Hammack SE, Toufexis D, Braas KM, Binder EB, May V | display-authors = 6 | title = Post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and the PAC1 receptor | journal = Nature | volume = 470 | issue = 7335 | pages = 492\u20137 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21350482 | pmc = 3046811 | doi = 10.1038/nature09856 | bibcode = 2011Natur.470..492R }}&lt;/ref&gt; This disorder involves a maladaptive psychological response to traumatic, i.e. existence-threatening, events.
