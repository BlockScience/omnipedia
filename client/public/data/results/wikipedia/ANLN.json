Staining with anti-anillin (Antigen 8) [[antibody]] showed the anillin localizes to the nucleus during interphase and to the contractile ring during cytokinesis.&lt;ref name = &quot;Field_1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Field CM, Alberts BM | title = Anillin, a contractile ring protein that cycles from the nucleus to the cell cortex | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 131 | issue = 1 | pages = 165\u201378 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 7559773 | pmc = 2120607 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.131.1.165 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations agree with further research that found anillin in high concentrations near the cleavage furrow coinciding with RhoA, a key regulator of contractile ring formation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Piekny_2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piekny AJ, Glotzer M | title = Anillin is a scaffold protein that links RhoA, actin, and myosin during cytokinesis | journal = Current Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 30\u20136 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18158243 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.068 | s2cid = 6310134 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2008CBio...18...30P }}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>\n<p>The name of the protein anillin originates from a Spanish word, ''anillo''. ''Anillo'' means ring and shows that the name anillin references the observed enrichment of anillins at the contractile ring during cytokinesis. Anillins are also enriched at other actomyosin rings, most significantly, those at the leading edge of the Drosophila embryo during cellularization. These actomyosin rings invaginate to separate all nuclei for one another in the syncytial blastoderm.&lt;ref name = &quot;Piekny_2010&quot; /&gt;</p>\n",

In agreement with this belief, anillin-mutant cells have disrupted contractile rings. Additionally, it is hypothesized that anillin couples the actomyosin cytoskeleton to microtubules by binding MgcRacGAP/CYK-4/RacGAP50C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Avino PP, Takeda T, Capalbo L, Zhang W, Lilley KS, Laue ED, Glover DM | title = Interaction between Anillin and RacGAP50C connects the actomyosin contractile ring with spindle microtubules at the cell division site | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 121 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 1151\u20138 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18349071 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.026716 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>\n<p>Anillins have also been shown to organize the actomyosin cytoskeleton into syncytial structures observed in Drosophila embryos or C. elegans gonads. ANI-1 and ANI-2 (proteins homologous to anillin) are essential for embryonic viability in both organisms. ANI-1 is required for cortical ruffling, pseudocleavage, and all contractile events that occur in embryos prior to mitosis. ANI-1 is also crucial for segregation of polar bodies during meiosis. ANI-2 functions in the maintenance of the structure of the central core of the cytoplasm, the [[rachis]], during oogenesis. ANI-2 ensures oocytes do not disconnect prematurely from the rachis, thereby leading to the generation of embryos of varying sizes.&lt;ref name = &quot;Maddox_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maddox AS, Habermann B, Desai A, Oegema K | title = Distinct roles for two C. elegans anillins in the gonad and early embryo | journal = Development | volume = 132 | issue = 12 | pages = 2837\u201348 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15930113 | doi = 10.1242/dev.01828 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>\n<p>In vitro experiments suggest that anillin drives myosin-independent actin contractility.&lt;ref name=&quot;kucera2021&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ku\u010dera O, Siahaan V, Janda D, Dijkstra SH, Pil\u00e1tov\u00e1 E, Zatecka E, Diez S, Braun M, Lansky Z |date=2021| title=Anillin propels myosin-independent constriction of actin rings | journal=Nature Communications| volume=12|issue=1| pages=4595| doi=10.1038/s41467-021-24474-1|pmid=34321459| pmc=8319318|bibcode=2021NatCo..12.4595K}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>\n",

In recent years, the expression levels of anillin have been shown to correlate to the metastatic potential of human tumours. In colorectal cancer, expression levels of anillin are higher in tumours and when anillin was over-expressed in HT29 cells, a classical [[colorectal cancer]] cell line, the cells showed faster replication kinetics due to the lengthening of G2/M phase. Increasing the expression of anillin also led to further invasiveness and migration of numerous colorectal cancer cell lines. The hypothesis from such observations is that anillin promotes EMT and [[cell migration]] through cytoskeletal remodeling, leading to enhanced proliferation, invasion, and mobility of tumour cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | vauthors = Chuang HY, Ou YH | title = Overexpression of anillin in colorectal cancer promoter the cell proliferation, cell mobility and cell invasion. | conference = Proceedings of the 105th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research | location = San Diego, CA. | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid27062703&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang G, Shen W, Cui L, Chen W, Hu X, Fu J | title = Overexpression of Anillin (ANLN) is correlated with colorectal cancer progression and poor prognosis | journal = Cancer Biomarkers | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 459\u201365 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27062703 | doi = 10.3233/CBM-160585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>\n",
