ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). The ABCC11 transporter is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance. The product of this gene participates in physiological processes involving bile acids, conjugated steroids, and cyclic nucleotides. In addition, a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) in this gene is responsible for determination of human [[earwax]] type and presence of underarm odour. This gene and family member [[ABCC12]] are determined to be derived by duplication and are both localized to chromosome 16q12.1. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene.&lt;ref name=&quot;entrez&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ABCC11 ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 11| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=85320}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>\n",
