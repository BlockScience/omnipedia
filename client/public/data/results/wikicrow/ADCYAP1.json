    "content": "ADCYAP1 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 (PACAP), which is a member of the secretin/glucagon superfamily. This protein functions as a neuropeptide and growth factor, influencing numerous physiological processes including neurodevelopment, neuroprotection, memory, and learning. PACAP is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is also found in various peripheral organs. The protein interacts with specific high-affinity receptors, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase and the production of cyclic AMP, an important second messenger in cellular signaling pathways (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP). The gene and its protein product are crucial in the study of neurological disorders, metabolic regulation, and reproductive functions, making it a significant focus in both basic and clinical research (Ressler2011Post-traumatic; Gu2002Genetic).",

    "content": "The ADCYAP1 gene encodes the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), which is a neuropeptide with a broad range of functions in cell signaling and organismal physiology. PACAP is involved in the regulation of gonadotropin biosynthesis and secretion, acting both independently and in conjunction with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH). It stimulates the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by activating the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway in pituitary cells. This activation enhances the expression of several genes in gonadotropes, including those for the alpha subunit of gonadotropins, LH beta, FSH beta, and the GNRH receptor (Thomas2013GATA).  Additionally, PACAP plays a significant role in nerve regeneration and cellular communication. It is expressed in medium-sized DRG neurons and is upregulated during the regenerative process following nerve injury. PACAP enhances neurite outgrowth in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons, indicating its role in promoting neural health and recovery (Baskozos2020Molecular).  In the context of metabolic regulation, PACAP influences insulin secretion and overall energy homeostasis. It is crucial for stimulating insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, particularly significant in pancreatic islet actions and mechanisms (Gu2002Genetic). This multifaceted peptide thus plays critical roles in hormonal regulation, nerve regeneration, and metabolic processes, impacting various physiological outcomes in human health.",

Variations in the ADCYAP1 gene, particularly the rs2267735 SNP, have been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in females. This SNP, located in a putative estrogen response element of the ADCYAP1R1 gene, correlates with PTSD diagnosis and symptoms, including impaired fear discrimination and increased startle responses in dark conditions (Ressler2011Post-traumatic). Methylation of the ADCYAP1R1 gene, which affects gene expression, has also been associated with PTSD symptoms, suggesting that epigenetic modifications play a significant role in the gene's function in stress response (Ressler2011Post-traumatic; N\u00c3\u00b6thling2021Genome-wide).  In addition to its association with PTSD, ADCYAP1 has been studied in the context of metabolic disorders. Genetic variations in ADCYAP1 have been screened in type 2 diabetic patients, although findings have shown no significant transmission distortion of these variations in families (Gu2002Genetic). Furthermore, studies in mice have demonstrated that deficiency in ADCYAP1 leads to hypoinsulinemia, increased insulin sensitivity, and altered body weight and adipose tissue mass, indicating its potential role in energy metabolism and obesity (Tomimoto2008Markedly).  These findings underscore the clinical significance of ADCYAP1 in both neuropsychiatric and metabolic conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in these areas.",

One of the primary interactions is with adenylate cyclase, specifically the isoform ADCY7, which is crucial for the conversion of ATP to cAMP, a key signaling molecule in many cellular processes (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP). Additionally, ADCYAP1 is involved in a network of protein-protein interactions with kinases such as GSK3B, PIK3CA, SGK3, and AMPK, which are integral to signaling pathways associated with neuronal survival and psychiatric disorders such as major depression (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP).  The protein also forms part of a transcriptional regulatory network, where it interacts with other gene products. This network includes feed-forward loops and regulatory motifs that are essential for understanding the functional dynamics of these proteins in psychiatric disorders (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP). Furthermore, ADCYAP1's interactions extend to the transcriptional level, where it is co-regulated with other genes, suggesting potential transcriptional regulatory relationships or direct regulation by shared factors (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP).  These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of ADCYAP1 in cellular signaling and regulation, underscoring its importance in both normal physiological processes and in the pathology of various disorders.",
