    "content": "The AGK gene encodes the enzyme acylglycerol kinase, which is a key component in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function. This kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of monoacylglycerols and diacylglycerols, leading to the production of important signaling molecules such as lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid. These molecules play crucial roles in cellular processes including membrane biosynthesis and signal transduction (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization). The AGK protein is also integral to mitochondrial health, participating in the synthesis of cardiolipin, a lipid essential for the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and serving a structural role in the TIM22 complex, which is vital for the import of proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization). Structurally, AGK is a membrane-associated protein with specific domains that anchor it to the mitochondrial membrane, reflecting its multifunctional roles in cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).",

The protein also features an N-terminal \u00ce\u00b11 helix that anchors it to the membrane, and a C-terminal region that includes an additional membrane anchor helix loop, suggesting its association with the membrane (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).  AGK is integrated into the mitochondrial inner membrane, oriented with its large C-terminal domain towards the intermembrane space, and is a subunit of the human TIM22 complex, indicating a role in mitochondrial protein transport (Kang2017Sengers). This structural arrangement supports its function in the import and assembly of mitochondrial carrier proteins, independent of its kinase activity (Kang2017Sengers).  Details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of AGK, as well as specific domains other than the DGK domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature.

These lipids are vital for phospholipid synthesis, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization). In mitochondria, AGK is involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin, a specific phospholipid necessary for the proper function of the electron transport chain and protein import machinery within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).  Additionally, AGK serves a kinase-independent role as a subunit of the TIM22 complex, a mitochondrial translocase that is crucial for the stability and import of mitochondrial carrier proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. This complex facilitates the translocation of proteins with internal targeting signals into the inner mitochondrial membrane, underscoring AGK's role in mitochondrial protein import (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).  Beyond its enzymatic activity, AGK also helps in scavenging mitochondrial diacylglycerol, which is important for controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling through a pathway mediated by protein kinase D1, highlighting its role in cellular signaling and oxidative stress management (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).",

    "content": "Mutations in the AGK gene are primarily associated with Sengers syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and lactic acidosis. Studies have identified specific mutations such as a homozygous mutation (c.3G>A, p.M1I) and a stop mutation (c.979A>T, p.K327*) that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting mitochondrial structure and the activities of mitochondrial complexes I, III, and IV. This dysfunction manifests clinically with symptoms like cataract formation, respiratory chain dysfunction, and cardiac hypertrophy (Siriwardena2013Mitochondrial).  Beyond Sengers syndrome, alterations in AGK expression have been implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of AGK in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is linked to increased tumor size and tumorigenesis, partly through enhanced JAK2/STAT3 signaling and an increase in the cancer stem cell population (Chen2013Acylglycerol). Similarly, AGK is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it promotes angiogenesis and inhibits apoptosis, contributing to poorer patient outcomes (Cui2014AGK).  Additionally, AGK-BRAF gene fusion has been identified in certain cancers, such as myoepithelial carcinoma and pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma. This fusion is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and resistance to conventional therapies, highlighting a potential target for therapeutic intervention (DOMEN2021Excellent; Sisdelli2019AGK\u00e2\u0080\u0090BRAF).",

    "content": "AGK (acylglycerol kinase) is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular functions and disease mechanisms. In the context of gastric cancer, AGK interacts with YAP1 and TEAD transcription factors, forming a complex that binds to TEAD response elements (TREs) on the AGK promoter, thereby regulating AGK transcription and enhancing the expression of downstream genes in the Hippo-YAP1 pathway (Huang2020Up\u00e2\u0080\u0090regulated). This interaction suggests a reciprocal regulatory mechanism where AGK not only is a target but also stimulates the transcriptional activity of the YAP1/TEAD complex, creating a positive feedback loop in cancer progression (Huang2020Up\u00e2\u0080\u0090regulated).  In mitochondrial function, AGK is a component of the TIM22 complex, crucial for the insertion of metabolite carriers into the mitochondrial inner membrane. AGK binds specifically with TIMM22 and TIMM29, integral parts of the TIM22 complex, playing a role in the structural and functional dynamics of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Vukotic2017Acylglycerol). Additionally, AGK interacts with ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39) in ovarian cancer cells, influencing mitochondrial function and impacting cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic resistance (Sun2022Acylglycerol). These interactions highlight AGK's role in both cancer progression and mitochondrial dynamics, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target.",
